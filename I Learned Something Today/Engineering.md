1. Car horns make that noise because they're basically just a speaker tuned to vibrate at a specific tone. Legally, you just need one. Fancier horns will have two, tuned a minor third apart.
1. Klaxons are interesting, and make that sound because a motor basically bumps a diaphragm up and down quite quickly.[YouTube for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adD5oC2asXI)
1. Switches click because they have to break the circuit fast enough to minimize risk from arcing slowly destroying the contacts.
1. However, a lot of switches aren't perfect, and they have some play before the spring to snap it into the correct position. Ones where you can get things in a weird half-on half-off state are pretty bad for a switch.
1. There are tons of different kinds of ways, but generally do it by generating a spinning magnetic field to spin the rotor, and thus produce motion. [YouTube for this and the next few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ3GW7lVBWY)
1. Getting electricity to "spin" is a little tricky, but can be done for free at grid-scale, since power is moved using 3-phase lines. The natural phase-offset of the lines ends up creating a kind of waving effect. This isn't a thing in domestic settings though, where you usually see 1 or 2-phase power.
1. Things that aren't expected to be run for long times (like food processors or power tools) at once can use [Universal Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_motor), which through their design can function using the normal pulsating electric fields of AC/DC power.
1. Fans are generally made using [Induction Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_motor), which are really cool, but can't get themselves started. They need to be given an initial push somehow, to generate the torque they need to get going.
1. Some fans provide the kick to start their induction motors using a [Shaded-pole motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaded-pole_motor),  which is a passive component.
1. Fan knobs generally have the high setting next to off to guarantee that they'll start up. If they started directly on low, there's a chance that the shaded-pole motor wouldn't be able to provide enough torque to start the induction motor, and it would stall out. This is mostly unneeded tradition though. [Technology Connections video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ3GW7lVBWY).
1. [Anti-Backlash](https://youtu.be/9JnP9qNtnIQ?t=531) is a specific aspect of (toothed) gear design, which is surprisingly deep as a subject. Backlash is caused by dead space between teeth, where things can chatter around a bit. One way they accomplish this is by kind of spring-loading one face of each tooth, so they can expand/contract to fit the valley appropriately. The nano stuff used by watchmakers is wild.
1. Michelin (Yes, the tire+restaurant review company) once made a car. Called the [Michelin PLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_PLR), it was designed to test big-rig tires without risking the nightmare that would be a big-rig blowing a tire at speed. It had a second engine specifically to power the test tire. It had lead installed in it so that it weighed 9.5 metric tons.
1. Indiglo watches (like your Timex Weekender) [work via](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/clocks-watches/question296.htm) electroluminescence. They have a very thin panel which is energized to produce light. "As described in the Timex patent, you take a thin glass or plastic layer, coat it with a clear conductor, coat that with a very thin layer of phosphor, coat the phosphor with a thin plastic and then add another electrode. Essentially, what you have is two conductors (a capacitor) with phosphor in between. When you apply 100 to 200 volts AC (alternating current) to the conductors, the phosphor energizes and begins emitting photons"
1. A [caisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caisson_(engineering)) is a big watertight box that'll be sunk into water so people can work at the base in a dry environment. Ones that penetrate mud are often pressurized. In those, The Bends is a serious concern, to the point that Decompression Sickness was originally identified in caisson workers.
1. For some reason, [sandhog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhog) is a slang term used for urban miners and laborers who work underground in excavation in NYC.
1. [Concrete is not Cement](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/cement-vs-concrete-same-thing). Cement is an ingredient in concrete, though the distinction is relatively recent and pretty limited to engineers and their ilk.
1. [Admixtures](https://cementconcrete.org/concrete/what-are-concrete-admixtures-types/2067/) are things you add to a concrete mix before/during mixing to modify a property of the concrete. For example, they may affect the setting time of the concrete.
1. [Spalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spall) is the name for small pieces breaking off of a larger solid body: "flaking", "peeling", "pitting", etc...
1. [Lockout-tagout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockout%E2%80%93tagout) is a safety measure to make sure dangerous equipment isn't accidentally started before maintance/repair work is completed. After turning off the equipment, one locks the control that could turn it on, and leaves a tag with their name+reason for the lockout on it.
1. A [Treehouse attachment bolt (TAB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehouse_attachment_bolt), sometimes called a Garnier limb, is a particularly strong fastener intended to minimize damage to living treas. They were invented by Michael Garnier, who worked with an arborist to develop them.
1. [Creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_(deformation)) is the name for the tendency of solid materials to deform while under constant stresses. [Concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_and_shrinkage_of_concrete) behaves differently from metals in that it will happen regardless of the amount of stress. Creep won't happen if the concrete is fully dried, but that's "next to impossible... without severe cracking".
1. You can [pre-stress concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestressed_concrete), by tensioning steel cables inside of it (pre- or post- casting). This is done because while concrete is terrific under compression, it's weak under stress, which this reinforcement helps with. Corrosion is a serious concern, as failure in the steel will release the tension.

## Logic/Circuits
1. In situations where computers/relays can't be used, [air logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics#Pneumatic_logic) is a cool way to control machines. They avoid the risk of explosions igniting controls, or moisture causing shorts.
1. Unsurprisingly, air-logic circuits are slower than electronics.
1. A somewhat confusing rundown of how basic logical elements are constructed from 3/4-way valves is [here](https://www.hydraulicspneumatics.com/technologies/pneumatic-valves/article/21122363/basics-of-pneumatic-logic).
1. Thanks to the DDC (display data channel) protocol existing and becoming entrenched, even modern HDMI and DisplayPort cables have an i2c bus in them. Couple this with the fact that tiny OLED dot-matrix displays often have an i2c controller, and you get [this](https://mitxela.com/projects/ddc-oled): a hack to directly plug such a terrible screen directly into an HDMI cable, only doing a *bunch* of work to get it functional as a screen.
1. [Time-division multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing) is a way to transmit multiple signals over a single wire. This is done by quickly rotating between which signal is being transmitted. WAV does this with the left and right channels.

## Tools
1. All sorts of weird drafting tools exist. [This one](https://youtu.be/PVQFvHuJHec?t=13://youtu.be/PVQFvHuJHec?t=131) is a compass(?) that splits a space into  two areas corresponding to the golden ratio.
1. [Japanese Saws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_saw) differ from most European ones in that they cut on the pull stroke instead of the push, since their teeth are sharpened "backwards". On one hand, they apparently don't work on hardwoods as well, but on the other they allegedly cut more efficiently and use narrower blades.

## Infrastructure
1. "[Italians] had to get a lot better [at maintaining infrastructure cheaply] after this, since they lost 70% of the budget. So a lof ot Italy's infrastructure just sort of collapses, metaphorically. And a lof ot Italy's infrastructure just sort of collapses (next slide please), literally." - Alice Caldwell-Kelly, [Well There's Your Problem, Ponte Morandi](https://youtu.be/-uUeBI7RnFM).
1. There are a number of [types of dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam#Types_of_dams). In a gravity dam, the force of gravity pulling the dam downwards is what holds the water back (overpowrering the water's attempts to flip it). Embankment dams are similar, but are made of compacted earth. Arch dams are curved upstream, so that water straightens the arch, strengthening it by pushing it further into its foundation, and are quite thin relatively speaking. You can also make a combination arch-gravity dam.

## Nautical Engineering
1. Why are ship bottoms generally red? To [avoid algae and whatnot growing on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AdW030xQB4). That sounds wild, but they're [anti-fouling paints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fouling_paint), and are designed to keep things from growing on ships. They're red because they're largely based on copper compounds, and those are naturally red.
1. SSDs (and other flash storage) uses a semi-conductor as a gate, to either trap charge or not, and that's how it stores data (Foone)[https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1336410974178295808]
1. CD-RWs [are wild](https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1336413407503818752), and use a laser to change a material to indicate ones and zeros. The burner hits a bit, melting it, which prevents it from reflecting light as well, which distinguishes 1s and 0s. How does this let you re-write? High heat melts the material, but a lower heat will make it recrystallize. 
1. Wildly, Blu-ray-re (meaning recordable erasable, instead of read+write, for some reason), does this over *multiple layers*. It manages to achieve it by making the laser focus at slightly different distances to melt only a target layer.
1. [Canal Inclined Planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_inclined_plane) are how you move boats between elevation levels. They're a section you can put a boat (usually in water), and then use cables to pull it uphill. There's an equivalent for trains, called a [cable railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_railway).
1. The [free surface effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_surface_effect) is a mechanism through which ships can capsize, and has to do with how liquids (and liquid-like solids) move in response to a ship rolling, as the sloshing can exacerbate the roll. To help avoid this, you want to keep fluid-holding compartments full or empty: using more, smaller, compartments; making them narrower; etc...
1. a vessel's [freeboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeboard_%28nautical%29) is the distance from the waterline to the upper deck level. Higher freeboards 1) make it harder for water to come over the side, and 2) increases internal volume which can help satisfy "damage stability regulations".

## Planes
1. [United Airlines Flight 232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232) was an absolute miracle of a crash. A metallurgical defect in the titanium used in the plane's engine led, over time, to stress fractures in the DC-10's fan disk. In this particular case, such a fracture had developed to the point that the engine exploded. The plane's hydraulics were severed, killing more or less every control surface but throttle. Despite this, the flight crew was able to "fly" the plane using only the wing-mounted engines for control. Without flaps or slats, they came in *way* too hot when attempting a crash landing and the resulting crash killed over 100 people. Not too bad, given during the NTSB's investigation no expert pilots were able to reproduce a survivable landing. Somehow the entire flight crew was able to recover and continue flying planes professionally.
    1. An extremely goofy extra fact: there were a *lot* of children on the flight, due to a United promotion for "Children's Day". 11/52 children died in the crash.
    1. Less goofily, it took 35 minutes for rescuers to identify which part of the debris used to be the cockpit.
    1. During the NTSP's investigation, it was decided that training for events like this was too weird to be practical, with landing in such conditions being "a highly random event".
1. [Flight Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_engineer) is a more-or-less defunct member of a flight crew who was charged with monitoring+operating aircraft systems, doing things like: monitoring fuel, hydraulics, engine power, etc.... With the advent of microprocessor monitoring this has been automated to the point of elimination.
1. A [phugoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phugoid) is an aircraft motion and "basic flight dynamics mode" of aircraft, in which the aircraft more or less "teeter totters": alternating between climbing and descending. It's often more annoying than anything, but with a high enough amplitude it can and has caused crashes.
1. To [ditch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ditch#Verb) a plane is to deliberately crash-land it on water.
1. [Earle Ovington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earle_Ovington) was the pilot of the first official airmail flight in the US, in 1911. How did he deliver the mail, you ask? He dumped the sack of mail out the side of the plane from 500ft, which burst on impact scattering the letters and postcards.
1. the [United Aircraft and Transport Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Aircraft_and_Transport_Corporation) was split up into Boeing and United Air Lines in the aftermath of the [Air Mail Scandal of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Mail_scandal) due to antitrust concerns around airplane manufacturers having interests in airlines.
1. [Airspace classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace_class) are, as a standard used to determine how planes can fly in them: whether they must be in contact with ATC, can fly by sight, etc...
1. The person who waves the lights to guide planes around is called an [Aircraft Marshaller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_marshalling), and they're called "marshalling wands". The hand signals shown for helicopters on this wiki page are quite excellent as well.

## Trains
1. The [Naperville train disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naperville_train_disaster) is a major reason most passenger trains in the US have a speed limit of 79MPH. In the aftermath of the crash, the ICC ruled that trains travelling at least 80MPH must have "an automatic cab signal, automatic train stop, or automatic train control system", and rather than installing the (admittedly expensive) equipment, railroads opted to simply run their trains slower.
1. [Streamliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamliner) are trains (and sometimes other vehicles) designed to minimize air resistance. The earliest known streamliners in the US had a pointed "wind splitter" front and rounded back, inspired by ships.
1. When trains travelling in opposite directions rould meet, they pass each other by having one train pull into a siding so the other can continue. What happens if one or both trains are too large to fit in the siding, you ask? You perform a [Saw-by](https://www.trains.com/mrr/how-to/model-railroad-operations/how-a-saw-by-works/) or double-saw-by. In a saw-by, the large train pulls into the siding as far as it can, the small train takes the main, and then the large train continues on to free the way for the small train. In a double-saw-by, both trains are too long for the siding, and one train must be split such that each part could fit in the siding, using the unbroken train to pull the separated part back alongside the siding so it can pass. This description is nonsense, the link has a much better description+diagram. Saw-bys aren't really used these days, since they're so time-consuming/expensive.
1. Freight railroads in the US are divided into [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_classes) based on their annual revenue: Class I carriers make more than $500,000,000, Class II make more than $40,000,000, and Class III is anything less. There are six Class I railroads in the US.
1. [Wheelslip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive_wheelslip) is basically burnouts, but for trains. This can damage both the train and the rail. In extreme cases, it can leave a dip in the rail where the spin happened.

## Automobiles
1. Highway interchanges are absolutely buckwild, and I do not understand them. Consider the [single-point urban interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-point_urban_interchange) or the [diverging diamond interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverging_diamond_interchange).
