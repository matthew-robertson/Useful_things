1. Car horns make that noise because they're basically jsut a speaker tuned to vibrate at a specific tone. Legally, you just need one. Fancier horns will have two, tuned a minor third apart.
1. Klaxons are interesting, and make that sound because a motor basically bumps a diaphram up and down quite quickly.[Youtube for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adD5oC2asXI)
1. Switches click because they have to break the circuit fast enough to minimize risk from arcing slowly destroying the contacts.
1. However, a lot of switches aren't perfect, and they have some play before the spring to snap it into the correct position. Ones where you can get things in a weird half-on half-off state are pretty bad for a switch.
1. There are tons of different kinds of ways, but generally do it by generating a spinning magnetic field to spin the rotor, and thus produce motion. [Youtube for this an the next few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ3GW7lVBWY)
1. Getting electricity to "spin" is a little tricky, but can be done for free at grid-scale, since power is moved using 3-phase lines. The natural phase-offset of the lines ends up creating a kind of waving effect. This isn't a thing in domestic settings though, where you usually see 1 or 2-phase power.
1. Things that aren't expected to be run for long times (like food processors or power tools) at once can use [Universal Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_motor), which through their design can funtion using the normal pulsating eletric fields of AC/DC power.
1. Fans are generally made using [Induction Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_motor), which are really cool, but can't get themselves started. They need to be given an initial push somehow, to generate the torque they need to get going.
1. Some fans provide the kick to start their induction motors using a [Shaded-pole motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaded-pole_motor),  which is a passive component.
1. Fan knobs generally have the high setting next to off to guarantee that they'll start up. If they started directly on low, there's a chance that the shaded-pole motor wouldn't be able to provide enough torque to start the induction motor, and it would stall out. This is mostly unneeded tradition though. [Technology Connections video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ3GW7lVBWY).

## Logic/Circuits
1. In situations where computers/relays can't be used, [air logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics#Pneumatic_logic) is a cool way to control machines. They avoid the risk of explosions igniting controls, or moisture causing shorts.
1. Unsurprisingly, air-logic circuits are slower than electronics.
1. A somewhat confusing rundown of how basic logical elements are constructed from 3/4-way valves is [here](https://www.hydraulicspneumatics.com/technologies/pneumatic-valves/article/21122363/basics-of-pneumatic-logic).

## Tools
1. All sorts of weird drafting tools exist. [This one](https://youtu.be/PVQFvHuJHec?t=13://youtu.be/PVQFvHuJHec?t=131) is a compass(?) that splits a space into  two areas corresponding to the golden ratio.
