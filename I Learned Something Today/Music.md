1. Distortion is essentially, clipping. It does some funky things when analogue components are overloaded.
1. Digital distortion is done through Wave Shaping, explored [here](https://benmosheron.gitlab.io/blog/2020/04/26/distortion.html). Wave Shaping is done by providing a mapping funtion for the range of the sine wave to produce the output.
1. Depth of a drum does two things: make it louder, and make it drier. [Middle Tom Syndrome](https://www.lowvolumedrumming.org/descending-toms/) is caused by the middle tom being longer than the high tom, and sounding dead/flat in comparison, because the descending look just *seems* right.

## Random nonsense
1. Zendaya is apparently a Kidz Bop alumni.
1. They're called Original SoundTracks to contrast with scores: meaning that they were composed originally for the piece of media, instead of licensing pre-existing music.
