1. Distortion is essentially, clipping. It does some funky things when analogue components are overloaded.
1. Digital distortion is done through Wave Shaping, explored [here](https://benmosheron.gitlab.io/blog/2020/04/26/distortion.html). Wave Shaping is done by providing a mapping function for the range of the sine wave to produce the output.
1. Depth of a drum does two things: make it louder, and make it drier. [Middle Tom Syndrome](https://www.lowvolumedrumming.org/descending-toms/) is caused by the middle tom being longer than the high tom, and sounding dead/flat in comparison, because the descending look just *seems* right.

## Random nonsense
1. Zendaya is apparently a Kidz Bop alumni.
1. They're called Original Sound Tracks to contrast with scores: meaning that they were composed originally for the piece of media, instead of licensing pre-existing music.
1. With upright bass, multiple bow styles exist. Specifically, [French and German](https://gollihurmusic.com/french-or-german-bow-which-should-i-choose/), the latter of which looks almost like an underhand grip. Allegedly French is more dextrous and German is more powerful, but it's largely preference. Orchestral players often use both kinds of bow so they can switch as needed.
1. Drums distinguish grip in a [couple ways](https://www.libertyparkmusic.com/drum-sticks-grip-guide/): most prominently with match grip (double overhand) vs traditional grip (weak-hand underhand).
1. Ozzy Osbourne is the only person inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the WWE Hall of fame. [Toddintheshadows](https://twitter.com/ShadowTodd/status/1521987595462320128?s=20&t=xQnBuAjYohQBV-F3tZu1Ag).
1. Kurt Feldman, the composer of Insert Credit, proposes a "Funky Hat theory of music": If an album is from 1984-1987 and the lady on the cover is wearing a funky hat, there's a high chance that album is pretty good. - [Brandon Sheffield](https://insertcredit.com/show/253/)
1. The inventor of the saxophone had a [weird ongoing battle with God](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/adolphe-sax-near-death-misses). During his childhood, neighbors called him "little Sax, the ghost"; his mother said "He's a child of misfortune, he won't life." For specifics: he once fell down a flight of stairs injuring his head, he once fell into a kitchen fire, nearly asphyxiated due to furniture varnish, nearly drowned, once drank a bowl of "clear toxic chemicals", and was once involved in a "gunpowder dump" explosion which launched him nearly 60 feet.
