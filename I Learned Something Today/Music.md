1. Distortion is essentially, clipping. It does some funky things when analogue components are overloaded.
1. Digital distortion is done through Wave Shaping, explored [here](https://benmosheron.gitlab.io/blog/2020/04/26/distortion.html). Wave Shaping is done by providing a mapping function for the range of the sine wave to produce the output.
1. Depth of a drum does two things: make it louder, and make it drier. [Middle Tom Syndrome](https://www.lowvolumedrumming.org/descending-toms/) is caused by the middle tom being longer than the high tom, and sounding dead/flat in comparison, because the descending look just *seems* right.

## Random nonsense
1. Zendaya is apparently a Kidz Bop alumni.
1. They're called Original Sound Tracks to contrast with scores: meaning that they were composed originally for the piece of media, instead of licensing pre-existing music.
1. With upright bass, multiple bow styles exist. Specifically, [French and German](https://gollihurmusic.com/french-or-german-bow-which-should-i-choose/), the latter of which looks almost like an underhand grip. Allegedly French is more dextrous and German is more powerful, but it's largely preference. Orchestral players often use both kinds of bow so they can switch as needed.
1. Drums distinguish grip in a [couple ways](https://www.libertyparkmusic.com/drum-sticks-grip-guide/): most prominently with match grip (double overhand) vs traditional grip (weak-hand underhand).
