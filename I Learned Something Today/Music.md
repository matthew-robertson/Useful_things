1. Distortion is essentially, clipping. It does some funky things when analogue components are overloaded.
1. Digital distortion is done through Wave Shaping, explored [here](https://benmosheron.gitlab.io/blog/2020/04/26/distortion.html). Wave Shaping is done by providing a mapping funtion for the range of the sine wave to produce the output.

## Random nonsens
