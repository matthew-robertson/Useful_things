## Frank Lloyd Wright
1. He was a pretty arrogant dude apparently.
1. While open offices were a thing for some clerical work beforehand, he popularized them in the modern era with his Johnson Wax office.
1. He was big into "Organic Architecture," the idea that we should be living with nature, not shielding ourselves from it.
1. As part of Usonian architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright created the idea of: track lighting, carports, and heated floors.

## Apartments
1. Penthouses were originally built as servant quarters: super hot in the summer, super cold in the winter. Turns out, the view is nice and there's only one per building, so they became a luxury. Came about because of zoning laws requiring setbacks.
1. NYC's setback laws were part of a 1916 zoning change, and led to outdoor terraces and defined NYC's skyline.
1. The Mansard Roof is one with a very sharp incline, and a mostly flat top. Created in France to get around zoning laws and create an extra livable floor.

# Architecture
1. "Compression" and "Expansion" are architecture terms used in designing spaces. "compressed" corridors are used to funnel people along and keep them moving, while "expanded" open spaces encourage people to meander around and mill about.
1. A ["Panopticon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon) is a style of prison (or whatever) designed so that one guard can watch every prisoner. Done by putting a guard tower in the center of a round room of individual cells. Spooky.
1. The opposite of a [setback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setback_(architecture)) is [jettying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jettying): building buildings out and above the floor below, usually to save street space. They were banned in London in 1667 because of the great fire, and in Rouen in 1520 due to air circulation/plague concerns.
1. The [Four-centered arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-centred_arch) or "Tudor arch"  is popular in both Tudor and Persian architecture. Apparently they "use space efficiently when used for doorways".
1. [Depressed arches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch#Other_types) are ones that look squashed. Tudor arches are a pointed variant of these.
1. [Wattle and daub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_and_daub) is a building method of packing some gluey material around a woven lattice. It'd been used forever, but you probably know it for its use in Tudor buildings: those white patches in the white and wood houses. Yes, wattle is the weave and daub is the glue.
