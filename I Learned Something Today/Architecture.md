## Frank Lloyd Wright
1. He was a pretty arrogant dude apparently.
1. While open offices were a thing for some clerical work beforehand, he popularized them in the modern era with his Johnson Wax office.
1. He was big into "Organic Architecture," the idea that we should be living with nature, not shielding ourselves from it.
1. As part of Usonian architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright created the idea of: track lighting, carports, and heated floors.

## Apartments
1. Penthouses were originally built as servant quarters: super hot in the summer, super cold in the winter. Turns out, the view is nice and there's only one per building, so they became a luxury. Came about because of zoning laws requiring setbacks.
1. NYC's setback laws were part of a 1916 zoning change, and led to outdoor terraces and defined NYC's skyline.
1. The Mansard Roof is one with a very sharp incline, and a mostly flat top. Created in France to get around zoning laws and create an extra livable floor.

# Architecture
1. "Compression" and "Expansion" are architecture terms used in designing spaces. "compressed" corridors are used to funnel people along and keep them moving, while "expanded" open spaces encourage people to meander around and mill about.
