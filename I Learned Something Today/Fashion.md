# General Advice
1. [Tanker Boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_boot) are military boots designed for tank crews. Unlike normal combat boots, they use leather straps over laces+eyelets. Civilian ones look cool as hell.


# Historical Dress
1. A bunch of this is gonna come from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoaksK9mZM) and her channel, probably.
1. In the 15th-century, women would wear dresses so long you couldn't walk in them. This is why we see them carrying armfuls of skirt all the time in art.
1. Structured garments (like corsets), weren't around until the 16th century.
1. Cross lacing wasn't really a thing until the 19th century. Spiral and ladder-lacing were much more common.
1. That comical bonnet you always see on "pilgrim" women is a real (ish) thing. But wasn't intended to block peripheral vision, and would have been smaller/further back.
1. The 18th century *loved* [ruffles](https://youtu.be/vAoaksK9mZM?t=786)
1. Surgeon's Cuffs are what it's called when a suit jacket has functional buttons. So named because they were introduced for military field surgeons so they could [roll up their sleeves](https://bespokeedge.com/blog/what-are-surgeon-cuffs) to avoid staining their uniform.
1. The [ticket pocket](https://garrisonbespoke.com/ticket-pocket-need-one-jacket)l is a second pocket on the right side above the normal pocket. Intended for holding train tickets, it's a more common feature for "country" jackets.
1. Pockets were originally [tied on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaRoWPEUTI4), not unlike a fanny pack, I guess. This was known to exist in the middle ages, and at least in women's clothes, stuck around for a couple centuries.
1. [Visual Kei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei) is a movement among Japanese musicians popular between 1980 and 2000. It's pretty similar to glam rock or hair metal, though less genre locked.
