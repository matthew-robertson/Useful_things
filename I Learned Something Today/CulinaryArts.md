## Fermentation
1. 2% salt by weight makes for a good brine baseline.
1. Replenish a ginger bug using one part minced ginger (1tbsp, usually) to one part water and one part sugar.
1. Feeding a sourdough starter is 50g starter to 200g white flour, 50g whole wheat, and 200g warm water. If refreshing from the fridge, double the starter.

## Baking
1. At least in baking (and especially with salt), always measure by mass. 3tbsp of kosher salt isn't 3tbsp of table salt, but 11g is 11g is 11g.

## General Cooking
1. Cook times are guidelines, things obviously depend on the individual thing being cooked. Go by temperature or texture.
1. Wash your rice before cooking. Maybe even twice.
1. Cooking beans in the oven helps them keep their shape better.
1. You can keep butter emulsified while melting it by shaking the pan somewhat violently. It'll keep the water in it.
1. You want olive oil in smaller containers, and in dark containers, to prevent it going rancid.

## Alcohol
1. Gin is just a neutral alcohol (essentially, vodka), infused with a bunch of botanicals: mainly juniper.
1. Distilation is done by heating up regular fermented alcohol, letting the "head" escape as steam, capturing the alcohol vapor, and leaving the "tail" behind un-vaporised. If an alcohol exists, it can be distilled: wine to brandy, sake to soju, etc...
1. Sake was served hot to mask low-quality alcohol, just take it cold.
1. Beer bottles are brown because isohumulones in hops break down when exposed to light and give off a smell similar to skunks.
1. Absinthe only really needs cold water added, to break chemical bonds and release essetial oils. Add it slowly to let every flavour come out.
1. Curacao's blue colour is artificial.
1. Angostura bitters are very firm that they don't contain angostura bark, probably for copyright/trademark reasons. Presumably contains some other part of the angostura tree though.
1. Quinine, used to treat malaria and in a billion tonics, bitters, and spirits, comes from a plant called Chinchona.
1. Tonic water will glow under a UV light because of the quinine alkaloids in it.
1. Vermouth is still a wine, and will go bad. Keep it in the fridge, use smaller bottles to fight oxidization.
1. The beer in beer batter is used largely because the boiling point is lower than water, and disrupts gluten formation. This is also why vodka is used in some batters. [Flavor-wise you want something malty and not bitter](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/103312)

## Molecular Gastronomy
1. Frozen Florida is an inverted [Baked Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baked_Alaska), which seemingly can only be produced in a microwave. It's weird.
1. Umami is tasted thanks to the amino acid glutamate. GMP and IMP also contribute significantly to umami, and all three are synergystic. GMP is more common in vegetable sources, while IMP is more common in animal ones. Hence the combos of Cheese+tomato sauce, and katsuboshi+kombu.

## Kitchen management
1. Kitchen zoning. Separate things by purpose, keep things near where you'll use it, and set things up like a grocery store. Stuff like:
  1. Pantry
    1. Rice/oats/pasta
    1. Sugars
    1. flours
  1. Cleaning supplies
  1. Tools
  1. Pots/pans
  1. Spices
  1. Glasses
1. Use Drawer organizers/shelf inserts and make more efficient use of space.
1. "Combine like things. Spoons with spoons."
1. Open top containers are rad for things.
1. Use lots of food storage containers.
1. Cutting board racks can be useful for pot lids.
1. Hang things that can be hung.
1. Keep your counters clean. Clean station, clean mind.
1. Do all these things to your fridge too.
