## Fermentation
1. 2% salt by weight makes for a good brine baseline.
1. Replenish a ginger bug using one part minced ginger (1tbsp, usually) to one part water and one part sugar.

## Baking
1. At least in baking (and especially with salt), always measure by mass. 3tbsp of kosher salt isn't 3tbsp of table salt, but 11g is 11g is 11g.

## General Cooking
1. Cook times are guidelines, things obviously depend on the individual thing being cooked. Go by temperature or texture.

## Alcohol
1. Gin is just a neutral alcohol (essentially, vodka), infused with a bunch of botanicals: mainly juniper.
1. Distilation is done by heating up regular fermented alcohol, letting the "head" escape as steam, capturing the alcohol vapor, and leaving the "tail" behind un-vaporised. If an alcohol exists, it can be distilled: wine to brandy, sake to soju, etc...
1. Sake was served hot to mask low-quality alcohol, just take it cold.
1. Beer bottles are brown because isohumulones in hops break down when exposed to light and give off a smell similar to skunks.
1. Absinthe only really needs cold water added, to break chemical bonds and release essetial oils. Add it slowly to let every flavour come out.
1. Curacao's blue colour is artificial.
1. Angostura bitters are very firm that they don't contain angostura bark, probably for copyright/trademark reasons. Presumably contains some other part of the angostura tree though.
1. Quinine, used to treat malaria and in a billion tonics, bitters, and spirits, comes from a plant called Chinchona.
1. Tonic water will glow under a UV light because of the quinine alkaloids in it.
