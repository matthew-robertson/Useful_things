# Historical Dress
1. A bunch of this is gonna come from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoaksK9mZM) and her channel, probably.
1. In the 15th-century, women would wear dresses so long you couldn't walk in them. This is why we see them carrying armfulls of skirt all the time in art.
1. Structured garments (like corsets), weren't around until the 16th century.
1. Cross lacing wasn't really a thing until the 19th century. Spiral and ladder-lacing were much more common.
1. That comical bonnet you always see on "pilgrim" women is a real (ish) thing. But wasn't intended to block peripheral vision, and would have been smaller/further back.
1. The 18th century *loved* [ruffles](https://youtu.be/vAoaksK9mZM?t=786)

# Historical Tech
1. Typewriters had a "lost" key: `‚Åù`. We don't really know what it was for, but [speculation](http://widespacer.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-lost-key-of-qwerty.html) is that it worked like we use the slash now, to separate lines: "Roses are red/ Violets are blue/ .."
1. Flicker was sput out of a social web game. They built picture sharing as a side thing for it, and it quickly outgrew the game in popularity.

# General History
1. Ben Franklin was apparently supremely bad at keeping secrets, so he probably wasn't in the Illuminati? (Sawbones: Ben Franklin)
1. [1200 pieces of bones (probably from about 15 skeletons) were found when renovating Franklin House in London in 1998.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-was-benjamin-franklins-basement-filled-with-skeletons-524521/) This probably isn't from spooky murder, but from the illicit anatomy school run out of the house by Ben Franklin's protege (Sawbones: Ben Franklin)
