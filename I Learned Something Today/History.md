# Historical Dress
1. A bunch of this is gonna come from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoaksK9mZM) and her channel, probably.
1. In the 15th-century, women would wear dresses so long you couldn't walk in them. This is why we see them carrying armfulls of skirt all the time in art.
1. Structured garments (like corsets), weren't around until the 16th century.
1. Cross lacing wasn't really a thing until the 19th century. Spiral and ladder-lacing were much more common.
1. That comical bonnet you always see on "pilgrim" women is a real (ish) thing. But wasn't intended to block peripheral vision, and would have been smaller/further back.
1. The 18th century *loved* [ruffles](https://youtu.be/vAoaksK9mZM?t=786)

# Historical Tech
1. Typewriters had a "lost" key: `⁝`. We don't really know what it was for, but [speculation](http://widespacer.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-lost-key-of-qwerty.html) is that it worked like we use the slash now, to separate lines: "Roses are red/ Violets are blue/ .."
1. Flicker was sput out of a social web game. They built picture sharing as a side thing for it, and it quickly outgrew the game in popularity.
1. Bjarne Stroustrup actually built another language before C++: C-with-classes. It wasn't as popular.
1. OO being so popular is kind of a weird accident of history. For example: C# was designed to be an alternative to Java, which was designed to be familiar to C++ programmers, which didn't get popular because of its OO but for its other features) [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm](https://youtu.be/QyJZzq0v7Z4?t=1864)
1. Python's OO probably isn't why it's so popular, since Ruby was specifically designed to be more Object-oriented than Python and has fallen by the wayside [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm?](https://youtu.be/QyJZzq0v7Z4?t=2118)
1. The World Wide Web was released to the public by CERN in 1993. That's quite a bit [later than you thought](https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/#table-of-content).
1. Spam emails are, in-fact named after the food Spam. It's [because](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-40505539) of the Monty Python sketch.
1. The [first image on the internet](https://petapixel.com/2012/07/10/this-is-the-first-photo-ever-uploaded-to-the-internet/) is a photo of Les Horribles Cernettes, added to a page about musical acts at CERN.
1. The first minifig released [in 1975](https://blog.hobbydb.com/2018/11/05/the-evolution-of-lego-minifigs-brick-by-brick/). There was nothing printed on them, and they had no moving parts.
1. Minifigs gained faces and moving limbs [in 1978](https://blog.hobbydb.com/2018/11/05/the-evolution-of-lego-minifigs-brick-by-brick/), and with it, small-scale vehicles got wider, to accomodate figures.

# Art History
1. There was a really quite large [monument to Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin_Monument_(Prague)) in Prague. It was built by [Otakar Švec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otakar_%C5%A0vec), [the winner of a competition no one wanted to win](https://twitter.com/lewis_crofts/status/1270786908768083969).
1. Otakar eventually committed suicide before the statue was unveiled, and in 1962 it was [destroyed with 800KG of dynamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otakar_%C5%A0vec#cite_note-rp-3).
1. Michelangelo was contracted to sculpt a tomb for Pope Julius II in 1505, and it was [a real mess](https://twitter.com/Ada_Palmer/status/1271057741134680064).
1. The Pope kept giving Michelangelo the runaround, so he fled Rome. The pope spent a while threatening the Florentine government that he'd march the Vatican armies on them, so Michelangelo was [forced to sculpt a large statue of the pope](https://twitter.com/Ada_Palmer/status/1271058832433852417).
1. Everyone (including Michelangelo) hated the statue, so after the city was lost by the pope, the statue was [melted down and turned into a cannon named "Julius"](https://twitter.com/Ada_Palmer/status/1271072810564280320).
1. Computer-related pain has existed [about as long as computers have](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dda7/how-the-personal-computer-broke-the-human-body). Though the nature of that pain has changed over time. Initially noise-based, eye-strain became a serious problem once CRT monitors and home computing became standard. weird pain and back-soreness became prominent as keyboards and mice became standard.
1. "No single computer changed the world, but computer pain has changed us all." - [Laine Nooney](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dda7/how-the-personal-computer-broke-the-human-body)
1. "What Zuboff observed was that as intellectual engagement with the work went down, the necessity of concentration and attention went up. What the computer did was make the work so routine, so boring, so mindless, clerical workers had to physically exert themselves to be able to focus on what they were even doing. This transition, from work being about the application of knowledge to work being about the application of attention, turned out to have profound physical and psychological impact on the clerical workers themselves." - [How the Personal Computer Broke the Human Body](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dda7/how-the-personal-computer-broke-the-human-body)

# Medical History
1. In 1972, The Black Panther Party added "Free healthcare for all black and oppressed people" to their (Ten Point Program](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024403/). Before that even, in 1969, they began establishing health clinics.

# Canadian History
1. In the 1980's, Montreal Police used photos of young black men as targets for target practice, which is pretty fucked up. (See Policing Black Lives, preface). I couldn't find citations for this (blame me listening to the audiobook), so [here's](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/north-miami-beach-target-practice_n_6482964?ri18n=true) an article about it happening in Florida.
1. Canadians still wanted to build plantations, but didn't because the growing season wasn't good enough. (Policing Black Lives, chapter 1).
1. Medical examiners in Canada were once paid bonuses for denying black migrants at the US-Canada border. (Policing Black Lives, chapter 1).
1. The Canadian government also paid black docters to go to America and convince potential black migrants not to migrate, as "the climate was dangerous for black people." (Policing Black Lives, chapter 1).

# General History
1. Ben Franklin was apparently supremely bad at keeping secrets, so he probably wasn't in the Illuminati? (Sawbones: Ben Franklin)
1. [1200 pieces of bones (probably from about 15 skeletons) were found when renovating Franklin House in London in 1998.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-was-benjamin-franklins-basement-filled-with-skeletons-524521/) This probably isn't from spooky murder, but from the illicit anatomy school run out of the house by Ben Franklin's protege (Sawbones: Ben Franklin)
1. In the wake of [The Great Flood of 1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_of_1862), the whole city of Sacramento was raised 9-14 feet. This is a wild idea (The Big Ones, pg. 102, ebook).
1. In the 1900's, people [reversed the flow of the Chicago River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_River#Reversing_the_flow). Mostly because the river was dirty as hell, and was in danger of causing some serious health issues.
1. A day after the Kanto region was devastated by a 7.9 earthquake, the ministry of home affairs proclaimed martial law. Vigilantes, imperial soldiers, and police murdered at least 6000 Koreans and Japanese socialists.
1. Pope John XII (955-964) was super young (between 18 and 25) when he became pope. He also was allegedly [murdered by the jealous husband of the woman with whom he was in bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes_who_died_violently), which is wild.
1. Why did Mongol terror last until Tolkien's time? Probably partly their success, and partly their curiosity for foreign cultures [here](https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2019/1/13/orcs-britons-and-the-martial-race-myth-part-i-a-species-built-for-racial-terror).
1. "Caucasian" came to mean white people, instead of people from the Caucus mountains thank to some weird "scientists" who classed humans into ~[three gross categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKB8hXYod2w)
1. [Adrian Schoolcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Schoolcraft_) was an archetypical "good cop", who ended up secretly recording police conversations to show corruption in the NYPD. They reassigned him to a deskjob, raided his apartment, abducted him, and forcibly admitted him to a psych ward.
1. Unclear if it's real, but there's a famous story about [Kafka and the Doll](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kafka-and-the-doll_b_981348), in which Franz Kafka discovers a child has lost her doll, and writes many letters to her as the doll, as if it were travelling the world. The story culminates in Kafka giving the child a new doll ("My travels have changed me.."), summarized as: every thing that you love, you will eventually lose, but in the end, love will return in a different form."

# Military History?
1. A [Decurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decurion_(Roman_cavalry_officer)) was a Roman officer in charge of a squardron (roughly 10 people), while a [Centurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion) was a higher rank, in charge of a century (about 80 legionnaires). A Legion would be commanded by the senior-most centurion of the constituent centuries.
