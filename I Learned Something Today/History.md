# Historical Dress
1. A bunch of this is gonna come from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoaksK9mZM) and her channel, probably.
1. In the 15th-century, women would wear dresses so long you couldn't walk in them. This is why we see them carrying armfulls of skirt all the time in art.
1. Structured garments (like corsets), weren't around until the 16th century.
1. Cross lacing wasn't really a thing until the 19th century. Spiral and ladder-lacing were much more common.
1. That comical bonnet you always see on "pilgrim" women is a real (ish) thing. But wasn't intended to block peripheral vision, and would have been smaller/further back.
1. The 18th century *loved* [ruffles](https://youtu.be/vAoaksK9mZM?t=786)

# Historical Tech
1. Typewriters had a "lost" key: `‚Åù`. We don't really know what it was for, but [speculation](http://widespacer.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-lost-key-of-qwerty.html) is that it worked like we use the slash now, to separate lines: "Roses are red/ Violets are blue/ .."
1. Flicker was sput out of a social web game. They built picture sharing as a side thing for it, and it quickly outgrew the game in popularity.
1. Bjarne Stroustrup actually built another language before C++: C-with-classes. It wasn't as popular.
1. OO being so popular is kind of a weird accident of history. For example: C# was designed to be an alternative to Java, which was designed to be familiar to C++ programmers, which didn't get popular because of its OO but for its other features) [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm](https://youtu.be/QyJZzq0v7Z4?t=1864)
1. Python's OO probably isn't why it's so popular, since Ruby was specifically designed to be more Object-oriented than Python and has fallen by the wayside [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm?](https://youtu.be/QyJZzq0v7Z4?t=2118)

# General History
1. Ben Franklin was apparently supremely bad at keeping secrets, so he probably wasn't in the Illuminati? (Sawbones: Ben Franklin)
1. [1200 pieces of bones (probably from about 15 skeletons) were found when renovating Franklin House in London in 1998.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-was-benjamin-franklins-basement-filled-with-skeletons-524521/) This probably isn't from spooky murder, but from the illicit anatomy school run out of the house by Ben Franklin's protege (Sawbones: Ben Franklin)
1. In the wake of [The Great Flood of 1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_of_1862), the whole city of Sacramento was raised 9-14 feet. This is a wild idea (The Big Ones, pg. 102, ebook).
1. In the 1900's, people [reversed the flow of the Chicago River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_River#Reversing_the_flow). Mostly because the river was dirty as hell, and was in danger of causing some serious health issues.
1. A day after the Kanto region was devastated by a 7.9 earthquake, the ministry of home affairs proclaimed martial law. Vigilantes, imperial soldiers, and police murdered at least 6000 Koreans and Japanese socialists.
1. Pope John XII (955-964) was super young (between 18 and 25) when he became pope. He also was allegedly [murdered by the jealous husband of the woman with whom he was in bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes_who_died_violently), which is wild.
1. Why did Mongol terror last until Tolkien's time? Probably partly their success, and partly their curiosity for foreign cultures [here](https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2019/1/13/orcs-britons-and-the-martial-race-myth-part-i-a-species-built-for-racial-terror).
1. "Caucasian" came to mean white people, instead of people from the Caucus mountains thank to some weird "scientists" who classed humans into ~[three gross categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKB8hXYod2w)
