# Terrain building
1. You probably want to be using XPS foam of some sort.
1. Etching foam with a pencil (sharp, or blunt), is super handy because the graphite lets you see what you're actually etching.
1. If you're using a pencil though, it has to be really short so you can maneuver it well.
1. Pencil etching works better on some german green foam, vs the pink foam you see in a lot of terrain building videos. This is because it's firmer for some reason, and rebounds less.
1. Scenic glue (very watered down PVA glue) is super handy for "setting" things like sand, gravel, etc...
1. If you're building a corner for terrain, you can either do additive stuff and build actual bricks, or you can fake it by butting the walls against a "corner" piece that has the right texture.
1. Tinfoil balls are great for adding texture. Make sure to do it before you use a brick cylinder (or whatever), since doing it after can distort patterns in weird ways.

# Miniature painting
1. "If you're spending 100 hours on a miniature, spend 60 of those on the face" - some miniac video. The face is where people should be looking. Make sure it looks good.
1. You need to use lighting to draw the eye to where you want it to (probably the face). Apply stronger highlights towards the face, things like that,
1. The paper mats that come with sta-wet palettes are meant for heavy-body acrylics, not stuff like mini-painting acrylics. Use parchment paper instead (not wax!).
1. Clean your brush frequently, and use that opportunity to reshape the head of the brush.
1. Two-brush-blending is a rad technique, and is super fast and very high contrast once you get it down. Learn it.
1. Take inspiration from everywhere. Graffiti/street art in particular can be rad for colour-scheme inspritation.
1. Working on some [larger figures](https://youtu.be/qqzqCC8RhXI?t=249), or on 2d mediums, can be great for improving your technique. Like with most things, don't try and improve in a million directions at once.
1. Like with most things, pay attention to what you enjoy and what you don't. This is a hobby, do what you like, but stretch your comfort zone.
1. You only improve if you figure out what parts went well and what went poorly.
1. Paint. More. Minis. Try and paint daily if possible. It's the best way to improve.
1. Read painting blogs like massivevoodoo, or videos like miniac.
