# Terrain building
1. You probably want to be using XPS foam of some sort.
1. Etching foam with a pencil (sharp, or blunt), is super handy because the graphite lets you see what you're actually etching.
1. If you're using a pencil though, it has to be really short so you can maneuver it well.
1. Pencil etching works better on some german green foam, vs the pink foam you see in a lot of terrain building videos. This is because it's firmer for some reason, and rebounds less.
1. Scenic glue (very watered down PVA glue) is super handy for "setting" things like sand, gravel, etc...
1. If you're building a corner for terrain, you can either do additive stuff and build actual bricks, or you can fake it by butting the walls against a "corner" piece that has the right texture.
1. Tinfoil balls are great for adding texture. Make sure to do it before you use a brick cylinder (or whatever), since doing it after can distort patterns in weird ways.
1. Warping is often caused by applying glue to a side, which shrinks when it dries and causes the side to pull. Ways around this include applying glues that warp less, differently shaped bases, or applying glue to both sides.
1. Chip board in particular is known for warping.
1. Corkboard can be used to make fake rocks, which is pretty neat.
1. Hot glue is one of your best friends for attaching things.

# Miniature painting
1. "If you're spending 100 hours on a miniature, spend 60 of those on the face" - some miniac video. The face is where people should be looking. Make sure it looks good.
1. You need to use lighting to draw the eye to where you want it to (probably the face). Apply stronger highlights towards the face, things like that,
1. The paper mats that come with sta-wet palettes are meant for heavy-body acrylics, not stuff like mini-painting acrylics. Use parchment paper instead (not wax!).
1. Clean your brush frequently, and use that opportunity to reshape the head of the brush.
1. Two-brush-blending is a rad technique, and is super fast and very high contrast once you get it down. Learn it.
1. Take inspiration from everywhere. Graffiti/street art in particular can be rad for colour-scheme inspritation.
1. Working on some [larger figures](https://youtu.be/qqzqCC8RhXI?t=249), or on 2d mediums, can be great for improving your technique. Like with most things, don't try and improve in a million directions at once.
1. Like with most things, pay attention to what you enjoy and what you don't. This is a hobby, do what you like, but stretch your comfort zone.
1. You only improve if you figure out what parts went well and what went poorly.
1. Paint. More. Minis. Try and paint daily if possible. It's the best way to improve.
1. Read painting blogs like massivevoodoo, or videos like miniac.
1. Makeup brushes make for good dry-brushing brushes. Only use your dry-brushes for dry-brushing. It'll shred brushes.
1. OSL (Object Source Lighting) is hard as hell. A decent technique is to do all your regular painting, and then apply a glaze to try and get the glow you want. Increase brightness/intensity nearer to the light source (for instance, using a really bright blue or even white highlights for something glowing blue)


## Airbrushing
1. Airbrush cups come in two main varieties:
  1. Gravity-fed: the paint comes from the top in a cup.
  1. Siphon-fed: The paint comes from below, letting you use more paint at once, at the expense of being harder to change paints.
1. Most airbrushes mix paint internally, to let the paint come out in a finer spray.
1. Airbrushes don't push the paint out, like you'd expect, but "pull" it out via a low-pressure zone in the front of the airbrush.

# Model Assembling
1. Mold-lines are pretty uncool. Using an xacto-knife is probably the easiest way to remove them.
1. Emery boards are also super useful tools for removing mold-lines and nubs. Especially the flexible tube ones.
1. When removing pieces from sprues, don't clip next to the part: it'll stress the plastic and possibly remove more than you want. You should leave a nub behind and either sand it off or snip it after it's off the sprue (with an xacto or otherwise).

# ...Prop making?
1. Sugar-glass isn't industry standard these days, mostly because it doesn't last very long (and yellows, and attracts ants, etc...). Nowadays people mostly use a very brittle resin, mentioned [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RVvgJD3vts)
