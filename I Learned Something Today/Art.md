# Pixel Art
1. 1-bit art is any art with only two colours. b&w is the classic, but adding a touch of purple to the black and green to the white (for a slightly creamier white, for instance) can add some nice colour temperature stuff while still reading as b&w [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BZwEoj50uw)
    1. You can create extra shades in 1-bit art by using dithering in various patterns to create lighter or darker greys. This is similar to the "half-tone" you see in black and white printing.
    1. It's pretty nice to not have overlaid things actually cover each other: leave a space of black/white between two white sections that overlay, for instance.
1. When building idle animations, don't have them move every frame, use that ease-in/out principle, bay-bee.
