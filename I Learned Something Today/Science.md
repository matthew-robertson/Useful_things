## Physics
1. The idea that skates work by melting small amounts of ice from pressure is a weird misconception, and we're not entirely sure why ice is slippery. In the 1800s scientists demonstrated that the pressure from a skate lowers the melting point of ice from 0C to -3.5C, which is cool. Why no one questioned why people could skate below that temp, who knows. (Randall Munroe, How To)


## Psychology
1. PTSD has probably always been with us. The Romans would report to people experiencing "intrusive memories" as being "haunted by ghosts". [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1j6ssm/are_there_any_indications_of_combat_ptsd_in/cbbvfib/)
1. [ICU Delirium](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-icu-delirium/610546/) is something that happens to a good amount of patients spending more than 5 days in the ICE (1/3 patients will experience some sort of psychotic reaction, primarily delirium). It's thought to be caused by the combinations of sensory deprivation, and sensory overload. Common treatments/preventative measures involve things like facetiming family members, providing sunglasses, etc... This has been a lot worse with isolation required by COVID.
1. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is... controversial. It's unknown if it's Western/culture bound, mislabeled (a la homesexuality in the 50s), or otherwise [see here](https://youtu.be/_ggrE_6fTDs?t=967)

## Chemistry
1. Soap is super good for "killing" viruses, because it's really good at breaks up lipids, which tends to make viruses fall apart. Most antibacterial stuff isn't as good as soap at this.
1. To quote [Palli Thordarson](https://twitter.com/PalliThordarson/status/1236549334654566401): "Similar molecules appear to interact more strongly with each other than dissimilar ones."
1. For instance, viruses tend to interact strongly with fabric, wood, and skin, when compared to steel or Teflon. Flatter surfaces don't let them "stick", and some rougher surfaces can even pull them apart.
1. "N-amino azidotetrazole" fucked up, but leads to even more [messed up materials](https://corante.com/things-i-wont-work-with/things-i-wont-work-with-azidoazide-azides-more-or-less/). Notably, the wildest one "cannot be handled". "The smallest possible loadings in shock and friction tests led to explosive decomposition". This is at a lab specialized in handling these kinds of things.
1. "The compound exploded in solution,.. on any attempts to touch of move the solid, and exploded when trying to get an infrared spectrum of it."
1. [Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/11/11/things_i_wont_work_with_hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane) is kind of hilarious as a compound. Developed to be a new explosive, it's not quite stable enough to use. There's been talk of making it more stable by mixing it with TNT. Which is.. interesting. Notably, heating it leads to CL-20 soaking in liquid TNT.
