## Physics
1. The idea that skates work by melting small amounts of ice from pressue is a weird misconception, and we're not entirely sure why ice is slippery. In the 1800s scientists demonstrated that the pressure from a skate lowerd the melting point of ice from 0C to -3.5C, which is cool. Why no one questioned why people could skae below that temp, who knows. (Randall Munroe, How To)


## Psychology
1. PTSD has probably always been with us. The romans would refore to people experiencing "intrusive memories" as being "haunted by ghosts". [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1j6ssm/are_there_any_indications_of_combat_ptsd_in/cbbvfib/)
1. [ICU Delerium](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-icu-delirium/610546/) is something that happens to a good amount of patients spending more than 5 days in the ICE (1/3 patients will experience som sort of psychotic reaction, primarily delerium). It's thought to be caused by the combinations of sensory deprivation, and sensory overload. Common treatments/preventative measures involve things like facetiming family members, providing sunglasses, etc... This has been a lot worse with isolation required by COVID.
