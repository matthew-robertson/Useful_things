## Physics
1. The idea that skates work by melting small amounts of ice from pressure is a weird misconception, and we're not entirely sure why ice is slippery. In the 1800s scientists demonstrated that the pressure from a skate lowers the melting point of ice from 0C to -3.5C, which is cool. Why no one questioned why people could skate below that temp, who knows. (Randall Munroe, How To)
1. "It is physically impossible to exceed the 70-pound domestic weight limit for a [USPS] small flat rate box." - [Paul M Sherman](https://twitter.com/PaulMSherman/status/1516936733769801734?s=20&t=bhihlVcyUDymQRxFUH09kw)
1. An ["Unstart"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstart) is the breakdown of a supersonic airflow, as seen in jets or wind tunnels. This can cause pretty rough loss of control, and avoiding them is a serious design consideration for supersonic aircraft that cruise above Mach 2.2.


## Psychology
1. PTSD has probably always been with us. The Romans would report to people experiencing "intrusive memories" as being "haunted by ghosts". [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1j6ssm/are_there_any_indications_of_combat_ptsd_in/cbbvfib/)
1. [ICU Delirium](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-icu-delirium/610546/) is something that happens to a good amount of patients spending more than 5 days in the ICE (1/3 patients will experience some sort of psychotic reaction, primarily delirium). It's thought to be caused by the combinations of sensory deprivation, and sensory overload. Common treatments/preventative measures involve things like facetiming family members, providing sunglasses, etc... This has been a lot worse with isolation required by COVID.
1. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is... controversial. It's unknown if it's Western/culture bound, mislabelled (a la homesexuality in the 50s), or otherwise [see here](https://youtu.be/_ggrE_6fTDs?t=967)
1. "The first stage of burnout is actually marked by a lack of empathy... It's the cynicism towards your work" - [You are Burned Out and Don't Even Know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqONINYF17M)
1. "What I'm looking for when I'm looking for burnout are people who on paper like their job, but are fundamentally unfulfilled by it... People tend to devalue their own experience" - [You are Burned Out and Don't Even Know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqONINYF17M)
1. "Three things we're looking for are: 1) lack of energy, despite ability to do work, 2) lack of empathy, and 3) lack of fulfillment despite on-paper enjoying your job." - [You are Burned Out and Don't Even Know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqONINYF17M)
1. A notable distinction between burnout and depression, at least allegedly, is the presence of [anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia). People who are burnt out will generally enjoy things if they can get past the motivation discrepancy, people with depression do not. 
1. The Dunning-Kruger effect doesn't actually seem to be real. It seems to be an artifact of [statistical modelling](https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2022/04/08/the-dunning-kruger-effect-is-autocorrelation/).

## Chemistry
1. Soap is super good for "killing" viruses, because it's really good at breaks up lipids, which tends to make viruses fall apart. Most antibacterial stuff isn't as good as soap at this.
1. To quote [Palli Thordarson](https://twitter.com/PalliThordarson/status/1236549334654566401): "Similar molecules appear to interact more strongly with each other than dissimilar ones."
1. For instance, viruses tend to interact strongly with fabric, wood, and skin, when compared to steel or Teflon. Flatter surfaces don't let them "stick", and some rougher surfaces can even pull them apart.
1. "N-amino azidotetrazole" fucked up, but leads to even more [messed up materials](https://corante.com/things-i-wont-work-with/things-i-wont-work-with-azidoazide-azides-more-or-less/). Notably, the wildest one "cannot be handled". "The smallest possible loadings in shock and friction tests led to explosive decomposition". This is at a lab specialized in handling these kinds of things.
1. "The compound exploded in solution,.. on any attempts to touch of move the solid, and exploded when trying to get an infrared spectrum of it."
1. [Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/11/11/things_i_wont_work_with_hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane) is kind of hilarious as a compound. Developed to be a new explosive, it's not quite stable enough to use. There's been talk of making it more stable by mixing it with TNT. Which is.. interesting. Notably, heating it leads to CL-20 soaking in liquid TNT.
1. [Carbonated water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonated_water#Chemistry) is acidic because the carbon dioxide being dissolved into the water will react to it and create carbonic acid.
1. The [new book smell](https://www.compoundchem.com/2014/06/01/newoldbooksmell/) comes from a handful of things, but it's mostly from the ink and adhesives rather than the paper itself.

## Cosmology/Astronomy
1. Apparently, there's a point at which things that are further away start appearing larger. [The intuitive reason](https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/1516548840177946624) is that the light we're seeing from them is *so* old that the universe was *way* smaller, and thus they were closer and covered more of the sky than we'd expect.

## Math
1. The [Pizza theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_theorem) states that when partitioning a disk into 8 pieces and taking alternating slices, the two groups will have an equal amount of the disk regardless of the central point.

## Miscellaneous
1. [The ISS uses UTC for its timezone](https://www.world-timezone.com/time-zones-in-outer-space/).
1. [Flashover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashover) is what we call it when more or less all exposed combustible martial in an enclosed area ignites at once. It happens when most surfaces are heated to their [autoignition temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoignition_temperature), often around 590C (1100F).
1. A fire's [Air-fuel ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air%E2%80%93fuel_ratio) is exactly what is sounds like. If there's exactly enough air to burn all the fuel it's a "stoichiometric mixture", or "stoich". This is pretty uncommon outside of lab conditions.
1. A fuel's [adiabatic flame temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_flame_temperature) is the temperature a flame would reach under "ideal conditions", and it's *pretty hot*. Worth noting: wood's adiabatic flame temperature is 3596F, and the LA Central Library fire reached temperatures of over 2500F.
1. [Snowball sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_sampling) is more or less a pyramid scheme to recruit study subjects from existing ones. Historically, it's been considered pretty non-random and biased.
