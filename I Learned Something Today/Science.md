## Physics
1. The idea that skates work by melting small amounts of ice from pressue is a weird misconception, and we're not entirely sure why ice is slippery. In the 1800s scientists demonstrated that the pressure from a skate lowerd the melting point of ice from 0C to -3.5C, which is cool. Why no one questioned why people could skae below that temp, who knows. (Randall Munroe, How To)


## Psychology
1. PTSD has probably always been with us. The romans would refore to people experiencing "intrusive memories" as being "haunted by ghosts". [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1j6ssm/are_there_any_indications_of_combat_ptsd_in/cbbvfib/)
1. [ICU Delerium](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-icu-delirium/610546/) is something that happens to a good amount of patients spending more than 5 days in the ICE (1/3 patients will experience som sort of psychotic reaction, primarily delerium). It's thought to be caused by the combinations of sensory deprivation, and sensory overload. Common treatments/preventative measures involve things like facetiming family members, providing sunglasses, etc... This has been a lot worse with isolation required by COVID.

## Chemistry
1. Soap is super good for "killing" viruses, becuase it's really good at breaks up lipids, which tends to make viruses fall apart. Most antibaterial stuff isn't as good as soap at this.
1. To quote [Palli Thordarson](https://twitter.com/PalliThordarson/status/1236549334654566401): "Similar molecules apear to interact more strongs with each other than dissimilar ones."
1. For instance, viruses tend to interact strongs with fabric, wood, and skin, when compared to steel or teflon. Flatter surfaces don't let them "stick", and some rougher surfaces can even pull them apart.
