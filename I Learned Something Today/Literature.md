# Writing
## Blogging
1. As [Sander Knape](https://sanderknape.com/2020/04/why-great-write-blog-posts/) mentions, a good point of blogging is that it will improve your writing skills, and help you write better documentation/notes in your day-to-day.
1. If you can't explain it, you don't really know it. Use blog posts to engrain your learning.
1. If it took you more than 5 minutes to find an answer to a seemingly simple problem, it might be a good sign you should write a simple post about it. Include error messages and whatnot too: you know how often you just copy and paste lines into Google, and other people do the same.
1. Simpler is better.
1. ["Just Write"](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/). Toss anything up, and do it consistently-ish. Write small blurbs, write longform articles, whatever it takes. Link to other people, share interesting things+your take on it. Just, do it more.

## Fantasy
1. [Spoilers](https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2019/1/13/orcs-britons-and-the-martial-race-myth-part-i-a-species-built-for-racial-terror), Tolkien's orcs were based off of some pretty harmful stereotypes of Asian people. For example: "The Orcs are definitely stated to be corruptions of the 'human' form seen in Elves and Men. They are (or were) squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes: in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types." - JRR Tolkien, Letter @210.
1. Which, after the quote that "The hobbits were 'a reflection of the English soldier'", woof.

# Quotes to note
1. "To speak gobbledygook to a black man is insulting, for it means he is the gook. Yet, we'll be told, there is no intention to willfully give offense. OK, but it is precisely this absence of will - this offhand manner; this casualness; and the ease with which they classify him, imprison him at an uncivilised and primitive level - that is insulting." - Fanon, Black Skin, Whick Masks "The Black Man and Language."
