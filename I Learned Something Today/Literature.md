# Printing
1. Those weird uneven pages on some books are an intentional printing choice (these days, at least) called a [deckle edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deckle).
1. A [Chapbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapbook) is a small book (usually under 40 pages). They're named for the salesmen who sold them back in the 1800s: chapmen (meaning businessmen. "Chap" is also where "cheap" comes from).

# Writing
## Blogging
1. As [Sander Knape](https://sanderknape.com/2020/04/why-great-write-blog-posts/) mentions, a good point of blogging is that it will improve your writing skills, and help you write better documentation/notes in your day-to-day.
1. If you can't explain it, you don't really know it. Use blog posts to engrain your learning.
1. If it took you more than 5 minutes to find an answer to a seemingly simple problem, it might be a good sign you should write a simple post about it. Include error messages and whatnot too: you know how often you just copy and paste lines into Google, and other people do the same.
1. Simpler is better.
1. ["Just Write"](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/). Toss anything up, and do it consistently-ish. Write small blurbs, write longform articles, whatever it takes. Link to other people, share interesting things+your take on it. Just, do it more.

## Fantasy
1. [Spoilers](https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2019/1/13/orcs-britons-and-the-martial-race-myth-part-i-a-species-built-for-racial-terror), Tolkien's orcs were based off of some pretty harmful stereotypes of Asian people. For example: "The Orcs are definitely stated to be corruptions of the 'human' form seen in Elves and Men. They are (or were) squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes: in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types." - JRR Tolkien, Letter @210.
1. Which, after the quote that "The hobbits were 'a reflection of the English soldier'", woof.
1. [Dwarves are also kind bad](https://dc.swosu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1172&context=mythlore), encompassing more than a handful of anti-semitic tropes in The Hobbit, which Tolkien spent a decent amount of time walking back in later works. Thanks, Rebecca Brackmann's Dwarves are not Heroes.
1. To paraphrase China Mieville "Race is true in Tolkien", much like in DnD and other fantasy settings.

## Comics
1. Dilbert's creator, Scott Adams, is a trash child. This isn't news. However, consider that the Pointy-Haired Boss - a decidedly Trumpian character - has become decidedly more sympathetic over time](https://www.theawl.com/2017/12/dilbert-a-reckoning/).
1. Garfield's color palette is an [impressionistic techincolor hellscape](http://wondermark.com/garfield-color/). The rooms in Jon's house are never a specific colour, different publications colour things differently, and wildly ingongrous colours will be placed besides each other.
1. Amusingly, a lot of the older archives of Garfield comics use a *ton* of colours that are "out-of-gamut". That is to say: colours that can't be reproduced by a standard printing press, and more or less only exist digitally.
1. Pre-2000, before digital colouring was common, colouring for daily comics was often done by separate production houses, and would [vary from paper to paper](http://wondermark.com/garfield-color/).

## Myth
1. The Golem is a [Jewish Myth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUBVSH6hBvY), and its Prague narrative is a surprisingly recent creation: in ~1837. Taking place in the 1500s, this golem was created almost as a detective to protect the Jewish population of Prague by finding the murderers who were behind accusations of [Blood Libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel)

## Commercial Fiction
1. [The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas#Educational_implications) has had a pretty disastrous impact on history education. A [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/gwenckatz/status/1487530360703361024) goes into some details. One of note is the use of a non-Jewish perspective as the narrator.
1. The author of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is the same dumb-ass who included [Legend of Zelda ingredients](https://twitter.com/DanaSchwartzzz/status/1290099395220799488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) in his historical fiction. A paragon of research.

# Quotes to note
1. "To speak gobbledygook to a black man is insulting, for it means he is the gook. Yet, we'll be told, there is no intention to willfully give offense. OK, but it is precisely this absence of will - this offhand manner; this casualness; and the ease with which they classify him, imprison him at an uncivilised and primitive level - that is insulting." - Fanon, Black Skin, Whick Masks "The Black Man and Language."
1. "Instead of insisting that Tolkien is worth of literary study but resisting analyses that present problems for the reader, critics should allow themselves (and be allowed by their own readers) to examine his books with the same approaches that they use for other texts, noticing changes, gaps, alterations, and biases in Tolkien's texts. After all, in the case of the Dwarbes in *The Hobbit*, he seems to have been perfectly willing to perform such examinations himself."
