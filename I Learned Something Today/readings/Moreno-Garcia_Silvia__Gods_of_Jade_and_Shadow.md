1. 'The night wind toyed with the young man's hair and he squeezed his eyes harder, he held tight to the deathers and the flesh of this supernatural creature. When the owl landed on the roof of a building, Martin could hardly contain his joy. He almost burst into tears. "Your cousin will be at the Hotel Mancera," the owl told him. Or at least he thought it was the owl who had spoken, although it might have been Vucub-Kame making himself heard through the animal, since the bird's boice had a flintlike quality that made Martin bow his head, respect instinctive in the presence of the unnatural' - Steal this for DnD
