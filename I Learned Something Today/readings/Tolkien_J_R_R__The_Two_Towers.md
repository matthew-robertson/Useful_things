Impressions:
On the whole, pretty good? I found myself kind of slogging through it somewhat frequently, dug the first half more than the second, and was surprised at the speed of the whole ent dealio.

Quotes/Annotations:
1. "'Boromir is dead', said Aragorn., 'I am unscathed, for I was not here with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was up away on the hill.'" - Leaving out the attempted ring theft, huh?
1. "Eomer's eyes blazed, and the Men of Rohan murmured angirly, and closed in, advancing their spears. 'I would cut off your head, beard and all, Master Dwarf, if it stood but a little highter from the ground', said Eomer."
1. "'Our friends were attired even as we are,' said Aragorn; 'and you passed us by under the full light of day.'" - I appreciate the reminder about the magic cloaks.
1. "'Of course, it is likely enough, my friends,' he said slowly, 'likely enough taht we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. THat thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now. It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the Ents may be worth a song. Aye,' he sighed, 'we may help the other peoples before we pass away...'"
