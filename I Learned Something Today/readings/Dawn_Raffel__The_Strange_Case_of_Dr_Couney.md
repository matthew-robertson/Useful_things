The Strange Case of Dr. Couney

How many babies had gone to their graves? Chicago was one thing, New York was even worse. The rest of the country, forget it. First, they said the incubators didn't make a difference and then they stopped to question if these babies were worth it. It wasn't as if there was any shortage of hungry mouths to feed. Why sweat these small ones, who might be a burden?
			

William Silverman came of age in an era when doctors all too often followed their hunches down the path of disaster. In prosperous, postwar, sunny-side-up, baby-booming America, the infant incubator (with its plastic dome modeled on the B-29 bomber) was standard equipment in hospitals. This was the good news. The bad news was the widespread use of treatments that hadn't been clinically tested. One theory held that since two- and three-pound humans can easily die from vomiting and diarrhea, it would be wiser not to feed them at all for the first few days. It worked! No more unwanted effluvia! Unfortunately, the patients died of starvation. Mortality rates shot up, and infants who survived had a higher risk of brain damage

Another disastrous theory had to do with oxygen. If oxygen helped preemies breathe, the thinking went, then more of it ought to be better. As a result, a generation of infants—among them Stevie Wonder—was going blind because of a mysterious condition called retrolental fibroplasia

Tarnier reported that his couveuse cut the mortality rate of weakling infants by half. There was, however, a delicate situation. The couveuse was a closer relation to a pressure cooker than to a mother hen. The boiler was so potent and the flow of gas at the charity hospital so uneven that, left unchecked, it raised the possibility of boiling the water in its bowels—and stewing the patients above

Certainly, William Silverman had more pressing concerns. Increasingly, he worried about the ethical implications of advanced technologies, of taking extraordinary measures to save barely viable infants who—if they survived, if their deaths weren't being painfully prolonged—might suffer from catastrophic physical and intellectual disabilities. In the years ahead, he would publish probing essays under the not-so-secret pseudonym Malcontent. He would wonder “whether neonatal medicine’s enormous increase in technical power has allowed it to become coercive.” When is it cruel to force a heart to beat?
			

This strain of eugenic thought would cast a shadow over the perception of premature infants and dim their prospects for decades to come.



Condemned to die was a healthy circus elephant named Topsy. The men who had ordered her death were Frederic Thompson and Elmer Dundy. The masterminds of A Trip to the Moon were building their own amusement park, visibly under construction. On their orders, Topsy was to be fed arsenic-laced carrots, wired up, and electrocuted with more than 6,000 volts

Thompson’s initial plan was to have Topsy publicly hanged and charge a quarter admission. Horrified, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals thwarted both the hanging and the profit. But the organization permitted the combination of poisoning/strangling/electrocution, which would be quicker and, they believed, less cruel. For educational purposes, the Edison Manufacturing movie company was on hand to film the event so that Americans nationwide could view

If Beth’s mother didn't want to discuss her lost twin, she didn't want to talk about Coney Island, either. As strange as that sounded to me, parents not talking about it would come up repeatedly as I started finding Martin Couney’s few surviving patients. Before I read too much into that, I had to remind myself that theirs was a generation far less fond of “sharing” than ours. Nobody would have spoken openly about a miscarriage, either. Nobody talked about illness—certainly not cancer, and nothing connected to intimate parts of the body or the psyche. So much of that past has vanished due to silence. How much of our own past, I wondered, will be lost amid too much 

The first child to die had been sick on arrival. Not Hardy’s fault. Another baby followed, and another, and another. Infected. In the muggy Missouri summer, machines were overheating. Perfect petri dishes, with no one competent to make adjustments. Plus, Hardy fed the patients cow’s milk, not breast, and it soured with contamination. As the body count rose, the good doctor up and quit.
			

The most damning report listed dangerously hot machines, poor ventilation, flies buzzing freely, and worse. “The feeding of the babies betrayed the grossest ignorance. . . . For instance, cereal foods and egg albumen were being used for these infants, although it is well known that they cannot assimilate such foods.” This letter was signed “City of St. Louis, Health Department.”
			Still the show went on. The babies kept dying

By 1899, the year after the eminent Dr. Martin Counéy made his debut in Omaha, DeLee had two Lion-type incubators; by 1902, he had four. But he struggled constantly for funding, relying on women’s charities to keep the obstetrics ward afloat. The primary goal was to prevent mothers from dying in childbirth. He would end up turning his incubators over to a colleague, Dr. Isaac Abt, who founded Sarah Morris Children’s Hospital in 1913. Isaac Abt did what he could—which, given his very limited resources, was nowhere near enough.
			If you had to be born premature, you’d better do it during the summer, when the sideshows were running. Born in winter, whether in Chicago or New York, you were most likely out of luck

In the utter chaos, the Times, along with everyone else, believed the babies had no chance. Ah, but this was always the story with these children. The initial grisly report stated that three had been carried out but suffocated, while “at least three other infants” were trapped inside. The next day’s paper ran a correction under the headline “All Well with the Babies.” Solomon Fischel explained that he and the nurses had rescued their patients and run to the home of a doctor named John Pierce. “He let us in and we put all five babies into one bed. Then the nursing took its regular course, and in five minutes the babies were as well off as if nothing

At the time of the Dreamland fire, Babies Hospital and similar institutions were rejecting incubators in favor of less effective padded baskets or warm rooms. Fear of “hospitalism,” combined with the labor-intensive cleaning of the machines, argued in favor of an open-air setup. Even taking a baby out of an incubator for a diaper change required more effort than simply picking it up from a basket. Hospitals couldn't spare nurses to sit all day and all night with a single child too weak to suckle. What Mr. Lindsay failed to note in his letter was that there wasn't a choice to be made between a sideshow and an ideal situation. The choice, in many cases, was between a sideshow and letting the children die

Then Dreamland’s massive tower collapsed, shooting sparks in every direction. By now the animals were crazed, and any hope of saving them was gone. Some of the trainers stayed and shot as many as they could, sparing them from burning to death. Soon the trainers had to run for their own lives. Little Hip’s trainer, who’d raced to the park, had tears streaming down his face as he heard his beloved elephant trumpeting in terror, with no possibility of escape. A three-year-old Nubian lion ran burning through the streets, roaring in agony, with his mane on fire. Police shot twenty-four bullets into the lion’s flaming head, finally felling him with an axe.

Woman’s Home Companion took up the banner, launching a nationwide Better Baby Campaign in March of 1913. The magazine predicted that the initiative would “advance civilization by leaps and bounds” in as few as two generations. If women’s organizations and local authorities would kick in the money for sponsorship, the magazine would provide gold, silver, and bronze medals. At state fairs, the highest-scoring city baby and rural baby would each get one hundred dollars in gold. And every baby at every contest would receive a scorecard, pointing out its merits and shortfalls

 How could Americans breed better children? A generation earlier, Étienne Tarnier claimed to have found inspiration at the zoo. Margaret Clark and her friend Mary Watts found theirs at the state fair. Just as farmers bred heifers and hogs hoping to win a blue ribbon, just as women baked blueberry pies for a prize, mothers might raise better babies for a competition.
			Beauty pageants were nothing new, but the women envisioned a different, scientific measure of merit. Points would be awarded for measurable attributes: height, weight, head circumference, and other putative markers of desirable development. Clark and Watts debuted their competition at the 1911 Iowa State Fair—and then the contests spread

When it came down to judgment day at the state fair, a “perfect” infant could be only of Caucasian, Western European descent—essentially Aryan.*
			

Later, I learned that the eugenically perfect winner of the Better Baby competition died of tuberculosis a few months after the fair.

. Harry Haiselden unveiled the third prong of the trident. He denied lifesaving treatment to infants he deemed “defective,” deliberately watching them die even when they could have lived. In some cases, the traumatized parents were in agreement; in others, he had to persuade them to believe that their children were better off dead. He wasn't the first or only doctor to intentionally allow a child to die, but he was the first to call the press. He eagerly displayed dying babies to journalists, in addition to writing his own articles for the Chicago American.

Helen Keller, the first blind and deaf person to earn a college degree, famously advocated for the disabled, yet she agreed with Dr. Haiselden. In Chicago, attempts to prosecute him and revoke his license failed. The Chicago Medical Society would finally succeed in stripping him of membership, not for letting his patients die but for publicizing his cases.
			Meanwhile

The movie was called The Black Stork. Released in 1917, it starred Dr. Haiselden, coolly playing a character based on himself, in a story loosely based on a real case. In the silent, captioned film, the newborn is afflicted with an unidentified genetic disease. His mother is upset—to be expected—but she accepts the doctor’s wisdom after a vision of her child’s miserable future on this earth: a life of insanity and crime. When a nurse tries to hand the doctor his operating apron, he sternly refuses her. Chastened, she turns and walks away, leaving the infant to die alone on a table. The dead child eventually levitates into the arms of Jesus. One 1917 newspaper advertisement read “Kill Defectives, Save the Nation, and See ‘The Black Stork.’”
			

But Martin was starting to paint himself into a corner, albeit a well-appointed one. With the culture changing, he must have felt he needed the credentials—yet anyone believing they were genuine might judge him more harshly. If he had truly been the protégé of Pierre Budin, if he had been educated in Leipzig and Berlin, then it would certainly seem self-serving and exploitative to persist in showing babies on the midway. Why not—at the least—publish clinical results, as John Zahorsky had done? Why not do what Julius Hess was doing, regardless of the frustrations?
			Martin Couney had no other recourse. To an extent, like almost anyone of a certain age, he had worn himself into a groove

Hess’s book was the first nationally published American volume in the emerging science of neonatology. It was urgent, he wrote in the preface, because prematurity was on the rise in Chicago, and because, “in the United States the care of premature infants has not received the general attention of the medical profession which it merits.” In the final pages, he listed the names of more than one hundred fifty physicians around the world whose work had influenced him, including Budin, Tarnier, and Credé. But he cited just one man in the preface: “I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Martin Couney for his many helpful suggestions in the preparation of the material for this book

Barbara Fishbein, whose father, Morris, was the editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association, accompanied him to a gourmet dinner at the Couneys’ almost nightly. Years later, she’d recall that her host professed to have learned his culinary skills while working as an aide to a general in France during the Great War. (Cue Maye quietly rolling her eyes. But of course, the army would send a middle-aged Jewish showman to do the gourmet cooking in France. Martin had no military record.)
			

Decades later, Martin’s niece, Ilse, and her husband, Dr. Alfred Ephraim, told the Gartners about leaving Berlin in 1937, and living in Sea Gate with their baby daughter until they could get their own place.
			With Maye dead and Isador gone to his grave not three months later, Martin was grieving not only for them but also for his homeland. Better than most, he understood what was about to happen, and he intended to rescue as many Jews as he could. The U.S. government wasn't making it easy. The leaders of the American eugenics movement were persuasive with the State Department: No flood of Jews. Not here. To arrange for even one person required onerous paperwork, an affidavit swearing to accept financial responsibility, and proof of the means to do it. Which was still no guarantee of getting a visa.
			Suddenly, Martin was everyone’s “uncle” or “cousin,” whether or not he knew them at all. He would meet them at the boat, and show them around New York in his chauffeured car, telling them where to shop, and what to do, and how to live in this country. Come Thanksgiving, the refugees were invited for dinner at his house. Most were soon able to fend for themselves, but he gave them money anyway, and plenty of it.
			In the United States, no one kept records of affidavits signed. Ship manifests show at least eight people coming to Martin; Ilse, who was there at the time, swore that the number was 

In 1943, Cornell New York Hospital opened the city’s first dedicated premature infant station. That same year, Dr. Martin Couney closed his show for the final time. He said his work was done

Dr. Julius Hess continued to treat and fight for preemies until his death in 1955. He is widely credited as the father of American neonatology

Dr. Martin A. Couney died on March 1, 1950, and was buried with his wife, Maye, at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn. Although the book of records he kept has never been found, every estimate puts the number of children whose lives he saved at between 6,500 and 7,000. There is nothing at his grave to indicate that he did anything of note.
