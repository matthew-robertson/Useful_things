Impression:
On the whole, not very impressed with this one. A lot of stuff that seems dated, obvious, etc... It's not especially focused, and less targeted at what I was hoping to read about than I was hoping. It seems very focused on Red Hat's implementation, with a more static app vs a webapp. Some neat stuff about testing (performance and visual), ideas for creating systems (even if the example systems aren't particularly convincing), etc...

Mechanically, the writing itself is pretty lackluster, and could've used some real tightening up.
