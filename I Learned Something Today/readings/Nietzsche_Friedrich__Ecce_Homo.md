Impression:

This whole thing kind of read like a shitpost? I mostly get the impression that I wouldn't much like Nietzsche, but it *is* quite entertaining. I wonder how much of the way the book is has to do with how late into his life Nietzsche wrote it? It's a strange autobiography, and it's interesting to hear some of Nietzsche's own thoughts on his works.

"Why I write such excellent books" Indeed.

Quotes/Annotations:
1. "I do not set up any new idols; may old idols only learn what it costs to have legs of clay"
1. "In my lifework, my Zarathustra holds a place apart. With it, I gave my fellow-men the greatest gift that has ever been bestowed upon them. This book, the voice of which speaks out across the ages, is not only the loftiest book on earth, literally the book of mountain air,- the whole phenomenon, mankaind, lies at an incalculable distance beneath it,- but it is also the deepest book, born of the inmost abundance of truth; an inexhaustible well..."
1. 'This double thread of experiences, this means of acess to two worlds that seem so far asunder, finds in every detail its counterpart in my own nature - I am my own complement: I have a "second" sight, as well as a first. And perhaps I also have a third sight. By the very nature of my origin I was allolwed an outlook beyond all merely local, merely national and limited horizons...'
1. "My experiences even with those on whom every other man has burnt his fingers, speak without exception in their favour; I tame every bear, I can make even clowns behave decently. During the seven years in which I taught Greek to the sixth form of the College at Bale, I never had occasion to administer a punishment; the laziest youths were diligent in my class."
1. 'To speak in a parable: I dispatch a pot of jam in order to get rid of a bitter experience... Let anybody only give me offence, I shade "retaliate," he can be quite sure of that: before long I discover an opportunity of expressin my thanks to the "offender" (among other things even for the offence) - or of asking him for something, which can be more courteous even than giving.'
1. "Why do I know more things than other people? Why, in fact, am I so clever?"
1. 'But even English diet, which in comparison with German, and indeed with French alimentation, seems to me to constitute a "return to Nature," - that is to say, to cannibalism'
1. "During the time that I am deeply absorbe in my work, no books are found within my reach; it would never occur to me to allow any one to speak or even think in my presence. For that is what reading would mean."
1. "It seems to me that to take up one of my books is one of the rarest honours that a man can pay himself - even supposing that he put his shoes from off his feet beforehand, not to mention boots...When on one occasion Dr. Heinrich von Stein honestly complained that he could not understand a word of my Zarathustra, I said to him that this was just as it should be: to have understood six sentences in that book - that is to say, to have lived them - raises a man to a higher level among mortals than "modern‚Äù men can attain"
1. "I am essentially the anti-ass"
1. "May I venture to sugggest, incidentally, that I know women?... maybe I am the first psychologist of the eternally feminine. Women all like me... but that's an old story: save, of course, the abortions among them, the emancipated ones, those who lack the wherewithal to have children."
1. "He who disagrees with me on this point, I regard as infected. But all the world disagrees with me."
