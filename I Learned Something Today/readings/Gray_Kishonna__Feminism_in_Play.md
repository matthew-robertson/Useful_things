Impression:

Interesting collection of essays, some of which felt much stronger than others. Nothing *especially* dragged, but you know.

Quotes/Annotations:
1. "Video games encode the injustices that pervade society as a whole."
1. "For women ,the sexually marginalized, and people of color, this treatment reaches far back beyond this moment, and stems from certain elements fundamental to games and game cultures." - from a paragraph about gamergate.
1. "As Lisa Nakamura states, masculinity is performed by the display of techincal knowledge, and gaming is the most recent iteration of this form of social display."
1. "Gaming itself becomes a mark of privilige within symbolic discourse."
1. 'One such effort to challenge the preeminence of masculinity in the game industry and carve out women's spaces in games, which peaked in the 1990s and early 2000s, is the "pink games" movement. While still pursued by some, in addition to fostering greater uptake and involvement by women, "pink games" also reentrench a number of essentialist stereotypes about women and girls.' - What an ouf
1. "Despite efforts to involve more women in games, the promotion and marketing discourses employed by the gaming industry are also complicit in reinforcing the assumptiuon that women are intermittent casual participants while men are perpetual hardcore players. - See: THat one list of "games women love" that was exclusively things like Solitarie."
1. 'Ray (2004. 29) argues that there are, historically, "two ways game designers deal with female represenation in games ... as a sexual object... [or] as an object to be retrieved or rescued." Other research generally affirms Ray's description of dual objectification, as in Pamela Takayoshi's 2007 study of gamer responses to games. Takayoshi (2007) finds that video games tend to exclude, sexualize, and objectify women; that there is discrimination against women among players; and that the majority of femalre represenation in games is understood as appeals to heterosexual men.' 
1. '...there are significant problems with *Gabriel Knight* if we are to read it as a feminist text. Desipte the overtly feminist summary at the end given to Grace as the surviging "strong female character," the game itself is generally androcentric, and tends to reward Gabriel's casual objectification of women. Indeed, the climax of the game quickly devolves into the familiar "rescue the princess" pattern that has been present in the video game medium nearly since its inception.'
1. "...but nevertheless, the patriarchal order is restored at the end of [Quest for Glory], and the player/hero amply rewarded for his part in aiding that restoration."
1. "Although the Baron is pleased ot have his son back, it is Elsa's return that actually wins the game." - See above.
1. "[the lack of player gendering] suggests that designers such as Williams tended to anticipate a more general audience than was expected later in the medium's development." - Does it? I feel like this could use an actual argument?
1. 'At the level of scripting in the engine, King's Quest II becomes even more problematic, demonstrating that it is not sufficient to simply have a woman in charge of a game to prevent misogyny in game development. The parser... lists words such as "bitch" and "cunt" as *synonyms* for "woman".' - Yo, what the fuck?
1. "However, it sets up a dichotomy in Roberta Williams's work: for men, marriage is a reward for success that carries no impediment; but for women, marraige is an imposing, threatening impediment to success."
1. "...designed primarily by Mark Siebert ...focuses on advancing through the game largely through combat in order to restore a mystic temple that is a male-only space that (apparently) holds the world together ,even though this temple and its central cultic object (the titular mask) have never been mentioned in another King's Quest game." - Scathing.
1. "This historical model suggests that if diversity *in represenation* is a goal, as it seems many members of the video game industry have made it, theremust first be diversity and support for that diversity *in the workplace* that generates that represenation. It is necessary for game companies to do as Sierra did at its height, and empower and promote female game designers' work..."
1. "It seems natural that, initially, female designers will be complicit with androcentric tropes, as Roberta Williams was at the start of her career; convention demands this conformity, and often it goes unnoticed and uncriticized in a team with minimal diversity; but provided creative exchange with other female designers... female designers can be emboldened to create games that explicitly discuse the female experience or create a gender-inclusive space for players."

1. "Physics engines control objects in the gameowrld via rationalist, rule-based, hierarchical logics. These logics better afford game mechanics that rely on Newtonian calculations of power and force, such as gun-based combat... the *material-discursive* and historical processed performed by game engines actively resist the implementation of real-time, post-colonial gameplay."
1. "Even while trying to build consumer excitement for the variety of play that Elizabeth will offer [in Bioshock Infinite], we see hints from Jeffery that the material and economic realities of AAA game development may impinge upon the possibility for alternative play designs"
1."Elizabeth is tasked with using violence to "clean levels", or to ensure that the other inhabitants in the gameworld percieved to be threats are pacified, controlled, or otherwise placed out of the way of her goals. Sich level cleaning dovetails with John Romero's "Tidiness Theory" of games, which posits that a core emotional drive for players is the desire to bring order to the chaos of game spaces, a theory that Cara Ellison and Brendan Koegh have used to explain the enjoyment of violent acts in games. Of course, the edict to bring rationalityh and order to chaos has been an axiomatic political frame for western Empire since the Enlightenment, and, as this chapter will argue, a political frame that has been embedded in the logics of the tools of game production.'
1. "As Mark Sample contends, it is important for humanists and social scientists to delve into the source code of digital texts, as the code itself reveals ideological and political assumptions held by the programmer. While Sample traces explicit political decisions made by programmers,... software need not explicitly deal with *politics* to be ingaging in *the political*."
1. "Algorithms are more than artifacts with embedded politics; they in fact *make* political arguments every time they are run. As Kate Crawford points out, algorithms and software packages, then, are not value-neutral or agnostic, but rather are *agonistic*." - Hello ML
1. "Digital computer systems apply rationalistic, Boolean-based propositional logic, an embedded ideological system that traces back ot the early ontological influences of mathematicians like Alan Turing and Allen Newell upon compuer science and artificial intelligence." - Fuzzy and probabalistic logic feel like they're worth considering here.
1. "Elizxabeth's interacitons with the gameworld , then, must necessarily be as simple to calculate as possible, while also returning definitive Boolean values; exactly the kind of determinism that magical realism rejects." - Does it though? Results at a point are conclusive, but need not be consistent moment-to-moment. Not sure how this squares. Is fuzziness enough to eschew determinism, or does it fail as computers are only pseudo-random? Are emergent systems not enough?
1. "Computing itself argues for imperialist ideology."

1. "Arguing that [robotic voice synthesis tools] reinforce normative definiitons of sexed and gendered personhood, [Roberts] states that simulated speech articulates a series of assumptions about what neutral inflection is, what a female voice is, and whose voice technology can ventriloquize."
1. "From electronic music to early videogame 8bit sound, the strict vocal ranges of femininity and masculinity are artificially recreated and emphasized" - Damn, is that something I've done unintentionally in creating Associated Arguments?
1. "Mary Ann Doane notes that [the the narrator] has always been a male voice, 'with its power residing in the possession of knowledge and privileged unquestioned activity of interpretation'. From a psychoanalytic lens, the *disembodied* female voice is subordinated to subjective and affective elements such as voice-over commentario, interior monologue, and flashbacks."
1. "Yet this is precisely the point that Mary Ann Doane and aothers make about women's aural presence on screen - that it is unforgivingly embodied, with the voice anchoring the *fantasmic* body to a real feminized obdy in space. We are never allowed to forget that the character is female, in contrast to the normativity established for male playable characters who get to be simply 'heroes' of the story."
1. "In the realm of early mass media, Dmitri Zakharine notes that there was a strong and enduring resistance to the high pitch of women's voices when it came to news categories in broadcasting journalistm. Women's voices were confined to 'soft' news connected to the comestic, whil men announced the 'serious' news with the authority of 'truth'. In mass media,l as with opera, we see the typifying of vocal registers to represent and embody specific narratives..."
1. "Sonically, narrative female voices are distinctly recorded close to the microphone in an imposed position of intimacy that is lower in register, almost whisper-like,and with emotionality encoded in the form of 'creaking' and vocal 'breaking'."
1."Dating back ot antiquity, Anne Carson traces the metaphorical associations of the echo effect with femininity; with unbridled subjectivity and lack of vocal agency (after the nymph Echo, destined to repeat the speech of others but not speak herself). In cinema and games, 'multiplicity' effects such as chorus or a pitch randomizer are interesting devices that signal, I would suggest, the inherent gender ambiguity of the hybrid, artifial (proto female) character- semiotically coded as transgressive and non-binary."

1. "[Nancy Drew] can use feminine technologiesx in order to solve her mysteries, but she is not *restriced to* those technologies; rather ,she must simultaneously understand technologies that, because feminine, have been devalued, *and* make trasgressive use of technologies that are 'not for girls.'"

1. "Compared to film then, women in video games are roughly 50 percent more likely to wear sexually revealing clothes and appear partially or fully nude and about 50 percent less likely to perform in principal roles ley alone appear in a video game at all."
1. "For instance, WIlliams et a. note that numbers of primary female characters were nearly identical to developer demographics in 2005-2006 (at 10.45 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively), but the increased numbers of women working in game devleopment (22 percent) have had minimal effect on represenations of female characters."
1. "Using industry measures, women have constituted from 31.1 (1998) percent to 44 percent (2015) of video game markets, so one would expect to see a wider range of gendered represenations"
1. "Modeled after the style of *Kaboom!* (1981), players control either two nude women (*Beat'em and Eat'em*) or two male prisoners with exposed penises (*Philly Flasher*) attempting to catch semen from a man ejaculating off the top of a building (*Beat'em*)  or a witch expressing breast milk off the top of a building (*Philly*)." - ?????????????????
1. "Indeed, sometimes the same character emodied [passive female and active male] attributes, as with Samus Aran at the dn of *Metroid* (1986), who "becomes" fenake by stripping off her Power Suit at the very same moment in which she transitions from an active player-controlled character to a passive sprite - in other words, from doing to being seen."
1. "photorealistic video game characters may result in more powerful normative effects than less realistic characters."

1. "(for more detail about the survey, the questions it asks, and additional reports using its data see [link](httyp://www.igda.org/?page=surveys) and [link](http://gameqol.org)). It is particularly useful for research about diversity and gender in the game industry as it contains an extensive set of questions about demographics in the industry and in educational programs, organizational policies, and programs about diversity, as well as developers' experiences of discrumination and inequity and their perceptions of diversity in the industry."
1. "When girls were given the opportunity to develop expertise and mastery in a girls-only video game club, they behaved in ways previously asribed to males" - I don't know what these behaviours are, but neat?
1. "..., Schott and Horrell suggest that games with easliy learned mechanics, reduced risk of dying or losing, and free exploration to acquire goods or powers might be appealing not because of a gendered preference, but because of a learned response to acquiring and maintaining control."
1. "Issues of access and expertise also exist in terms of the games played. As Consalvo and Paul articulated, tghe game community cultivates a system of insiders and outsiders by privileging 'real' games and positioning those who play them as 'real gamers.' Consalvo and Paul identified the importance of developer pedigree, particular game mechanics, the depth of interactive meaning, and the price/pay structure of games as tacit signals of which games matter and which do not. This is largely an approach to occupational closure that is common to many profesisonal and professional-izing occupations as it effectively denigrates new entrants and forces them to compl' Consalvo and Paul identified the importance of developer pedigree, particular game mechanics, the depth of interactive meaning, and the price/pay structure of games as tacit signals of which games matter and which do not. This is largely an approach to occupational closure that is common to many profesisonal and professional-izing occupations as it effectively denigrates new entrants and forces them to comply with the standard in which natives are heavily investiced. However, this protectionist attitude and the reification of real games and gamers further disenfranchise women who have invested time in the wrong games. It also may prevent girls and women from leveraging innovations in technology to gain access to the game space rather than evening the playing field if these innovations are devalued. Research suggests taht women have taken up the social and casual games populating Facebook and mobile devices and that casual games innovation in game controlled such as the Wii may have removed some barriers to entry."
1. "Despite these differences in degree and occupation, among the student respondents, there was no gendered difference regarding a love for the industry and the importance of early experiences. Males and females responded similarly to questions about being passionate about games and wanting to share this by being in the industry... That said, females were significantly less likely than males to agree that there was 'equal treatment and opportunity for all in game-related educational programs'; 50$ of females versus 17$ of males said there was not equal treatment for all."
1. "For instance, compared to males, twice as many females than males reported experiencing inequity in recruitment and hiring processes, four times as many females reported experiencing inequity in the promotion process, five times as many females reported inequity on monetary grounds, six times as many females reported microagressions in the workplace (verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities), and seven times as many females reported experiencing inequity in both discipline and social/interpersonal interactions. The absolute incidence of these inequities for all genders ranged from 8 to 16% of respondents, but the relative incidence for women is striking."
1. "For instance, in the 2015 DSS, respondents reported that crunch time or long hours had negatively affected their family relationships (50%), their emotional health (58%), and their physical health (55%)." - Devs really need to unionize
1. "Work that is done primarily by women, evin if once dominated by men, faces a legacy of devaluation."
1. 'In her study of women game designers in North America, Consalvo problematizes the concept of passion because it "serve[s] as a unifying ideaology from which development companies can draw in order to justify various practices that might be considered exploitative in other industries". Loyalty, in Japan, functions in a similar way because it holds workers accountable for their commitment within a *nakama*..."

1. "The concept of magical circle has been widely discussed in the field of games study, mostly regarding the frontiers that separate the games from the common world." - Is this what the game of the same name is referencing?
1. "As it occured before, self-affirming manhood manifestations also became stronger as feminist protests grew on new media, generating new ways of reassurance of the sexist culture still hegemonic in the country."

1. "Another recent study was conducted on comments by Twitch users in channel chats. The researchers found that comments on female identifying streamers' channels often included words unrelated to gaming such as 'boobs', 'babe', 'smile', or 'omg'." - I.. Don't know why OMG is included in this list?
1. "Not only did the female streamers in the study have larger camera feeds in relation to the size of the gameplay screen, they also provided more personal information in their profile,..." - Oh no
1. "To some degree, the women described by Levy appear to be stuck in the 'cool girl trap' - an expression coined by author Gillian Flynn in her novel Gone Girl..."
1. "The most successful streamers in terms of viewers and subscribers on Twitch are still men."
