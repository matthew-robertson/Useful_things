Impression:
Self-admittedly a US-centric history, which isn't a problem. There wasn't a ton of wholly new to me stuff here, especially given the depth at which individual topics are covered, but it's an excellent primer for folks new to this. It also provides tones of citations and further reading recommendations, which seems like a lovely jumping off point. The writing is decidedly approachable which makes it easy to recommend outside academia.

Quotes/Annotations:
1. "In any case, it is the movement across a socially imposed boundary away from an unchosen starting place, rather than any particular destination or mode of transition, that best characterizes the concept of transgender that I develop here. I just *transgender* in its broadest possible sense."
1. 'Generally speaking, "first wave"  feminism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries focused on dress reform, access to education, political equality, and, above all, suffrage-the right to vote. "Second wave" feminism, also known as the "women's movement," took off in the 1960s and addressed a wide range of issues that included equal pay, sexual liberation, lesbianism, reproductive freedom, recognition of women's unpaid work in the household, better media representations of women, self-defense, and the prevention of rape and domestic violence. A feminist "third wave" emerged in the 1990s, partly in response to the perceived shortcomings of earlier generational inflections of feminism, and partly to focus on emerging issues. Third wave feminists considered themselves more sex-positive than their mothers and grandmothers....They were more interested in contesting body-shaming politics, in having a subversive or ironic relationship to consumer culture, and in engaging in online activism through social media. There's even talk of a fourth wave, taking shape in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, that is more attuned... to the politics of Occupy, Black Lives Matter, environmental justice, techno-literacy- and spirituality.'
1. 'More important than parsing the various generational "waves" of feminism, however, is the emergence of what has come to be called "intersectional" feminism. Rooted in black and Chicana feminist thought, intersectional feminism calls into question the idea that the social oppression of women can be adequately analyzed and contested solely by concentrating on the category "women"'
1. "Breaking apart the forced unity of sex and gender, while increasing the scope of livable lives, needs to be a central goal of feminism and other forms of social justice activism. This is important for everybody, especially, but not exclusively, for trans people."
1. "*Gender dysphoria* was a common term among medical and psychotherapeutic professionals who worked with transgender populations in the 1860s through the 1980s, but it was gradually supplanted by the now-discredited diagnostic category Gender Identity Disorder... Partly in response to transgender activism that contested the pathologization of trans identities, *gender dysphoria* came back into fashion in the twenty-first century as part of an argument for why transgender health care needs should be covered by medical insurance. It suggests that it is the sense of unhappiness that is not healthful and that is susceptible to therapeutic treatment rather than that a transgender person is inherently disordered..."
1. 'The DSM-V also notes that many individuals who experience gender incongruence are not distressed by it, but that considerable distress for gender-incongruent people can occurs "if the desired physical interventions by means of hormones and/or surgery are not available."'
1. "Paying attention to habitus calls our attention to the fact that, although bodies are certainly different from one another, it's what we do with those bodies, how we use and transform those bodies, that is often even more important in making us who was are than what we're born with."
1. "All human bodies are modified bodies: they are bodies that diet and exercise, that get pierced and tattooed, whose feet get shaped by the kind of shoes they wear.... it's virtually impossible to practice and kind of body modification without other members of society having an opinion about whether the practice is good or bad, or right or wrong."
1. "Intersex conditions are far more common than we tend to acknowledge: reliable estimates put the number at about one in two thousand births. Intersex doesn't really have all that much to do with transgender, except for demonstrating that the biology of sex is a lot more variable than most people realize."
1. 'Although [queer]'s now often used as a synonym for gay or lesbian, the people who first reappropriated the term were trying to find a way to talk about their opposition to heterosexist social norms; *queer* was less a sexual orientation than it was a political one, what the "queer theorists"  of the day called being "antihereronormative."'
1. 'Hirschfeld's work came to a tragically abrupt end in the 1930s.... Adolf Hitler personally denounced Hirschfeld, who was a socialist as well as a gay man, as "the most dangerous Jew in Germany". Fearing for his life if he remained in the country, Hirschfeld turned a planned visit to the United States into an around-the-world lecture tour. Between 1930 and 1933 he... [preached] his vision of politically progressive sexual science. In 1933, fascist vigilantes ransacked and destroyed Hirschfeld's institute in Berlin; the most familiar photo of Nazi book burning depicts Hirschfeld's library of materials on sexual diversity going up in flames, a bust of Hirschfeld himself clearly visible in the bonfire.'
1. 'In 1949, Bowman and Kinsey, along with transsexual medical pioneer Harry Benjamin and future California governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown (then California's state attorney general), became involved in a legal case involving one of Lawrence's friends that had long-lasting repercussions for the course of transgender access to medical services in the United States. Brown, on the advice of Bowman and Kinsey but over the objections of Benjamin, offered the legal opinion that transsexual genital modification would constitute "mayhem" (the willful destruction of healthy tissue) and expose any surgeon who performed such an operation to possible criminal prosecution. That opinion cast a pall, lasting for years, over efforts by US transgender people to gain access to transsexual medical procedures in their own country. In the 1950s, only a few dozen "sex change" operations were performed in the United States, most of them by Los Angeles urologist Elmer Belt (a friend of Benjamin's), under conditions of strict secrecy' - Kinda rough that we seem to be headed right back there.
1. "In 1952, Prince and a group of transvestites who met regularly in Long Beach published an unprecedented newsletter - *Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress* - which they distributed to a mailing list consisting largely of Lawrence's correspondents. This little mimeographed publication, which existed for only two issues, is arguably the first overtly political transgender publication in US history. Even its subtitle seems deliberately intended to evoke the dress reform activism of nineteenth-century first wave feminism."
1. "Both transvestitism and transsexuality came to be seen as something different from either homosexuality or intersexuality. All four categories strove to articulate the complex and variable interrelations between social gender, psychological identity, and physical sex - intellectual labor that informed the concept of a "sex/gender system" that became an important theoretical development within the emerging second wave feminist movement. By the end of the 1950s, the identity labels and border skirmishes between identity-based communities that still inform transgender activism today had largely fallen into place."
1. "As the Prince prosecution demonstrates, the state's actions often regulate bodies, in ways both great and small, by enmeshing them within norms and expectations that determine what kinds of lives are deemed livable or useful and by shutting down the spaces of possibility and imaginative transformation where people's lives begin to exceed and escape the state's uses for them."
1. "A similar though nonviolent incident tok place in Philadelphia in 1965 at Dewey's, a lunch counter and late-night coffeehouse that appealed to a crowd similar to the one that frequented Cooper's.... In April 1965, Dewey's started refusing to serve young customers who wore what one gay newspaper of the day euphemistically described as 'nonconformist clothing,' claiming that 'gay kids' were driving away other business. Customers rallied to protest, and on April 25, more than 150 patrons were turned away by the management. Three teenagers refused to leave after being denied service in what appears to be the first act of civil disobedience over anti-transgender discrimination"
1. "Lunch counter sit-ins had been developed as a form of protest to oppose racial segregation in the South, but they proved equally effective when used to promote the interests of sexual and gender minorities. It would be a mistake, however, to think that the African American civil rights struggle simply 'influenced' early gay and transgender activism at Dewey's, for to do so would be to assume that all the gay and transgender people involved were white. Many of the queer people who patronized Dewey's were themselves people of color, and they were not 'borrowing' a tactic developed by another movement."
1. "Wartime is typically a time of heightened surveillance of commercial sexual activity in cities where large numbers of troops are being mobilized for deployment. Military and civilian police, along with public health officials, cooperate to prevent troops ... from acquiring sexually transmitted infections that might compromise their combat readiness... There were wartime crackdowns on prostitution in San Francisco during the Spanish-American War in the Philippines in the 1890s, during World War II in the 1940s, and during the Korean conflict in the 1950s."
1. "The 'Stonewall Riots' have been mythologized as the origin of the gay liberation movement, and there is a great deal of truth in that characterization, but - as we have seen - gay, transgender, and gender-nonconforming" people had been engaging in militant protest and collective actions against social oppression for at least a decade by that time. Stonewall stands out as the biggest and most consequential example of a kind of event that was becoming increasingly common, rather than as a unique occurrence."
1. "Transgenderism and homosexuality had been conceptually interrelated since the nineteenth century, and transgender politics, the homophile movement, and gay liberation had run alongside one another and sometimes intersected throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The early 1970s, however, represented a watershed moment in this shared history when the transgender political movement lost its alliances with gay and feminist communities in ways that did not begin to be repaired until the early 1990s and that, in many ways, have yet to be fully overcome. Although gay liberation and feminism are typically considered politically progressive developments, for transgender people they often constituted another part of the backlash, in large part because of the different relationships these movements and identities had to institutionalized medical, scientific, and legal powers and to minority civil rights discourse."
1. "In many respects, the transgender movement's politics towards the medical establishment were more like those of the reproductive justice movement than those of the gay liberation movement."
1. "One consequence of this shift away from 'roles' ant toward androgyny in lesbian and feminist culture was the foreclosure of social space that tolerated - or even celebrated - transmasculine people, along with the women who loved them, who previously had had a place in women's and lesbian communities. The erosion of that space directly influenced the formation of FTM transgender communities by the middle years of the 1980s." 
1. "In 1973, two separate San Francisco Pride events were organized, one by the Broshears, and the other by gays and lesbians who opposed drag and expressly forbid transgender people from participating. Broshears never organized another Hay Pride event, while the anti-drag event became the forerunner of the current San Francisco LGBTQ Pride celebration."
1. "First, Raymond explicitly identifies the practice of transsexuality with rape, unequivocally stating: 'All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves;' she asserts that the mere presence of male-to-female transsexuals in women's space 'violates women's sexuality and spirit.' Rape, she claims, is usually accomplished by force, but it can also be accomplished by deception; male-to-female transsexuals who seek to be involved in women's and feminist communities 'merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women,' but they continue to rape women,..., whenever they do not declare themselves to be transsexuals." - What the actual fuck?
1. "She then constructs a string of false syllogisms, inferences, and analogies that work to associate transsexuality with Nazism without actually asserting that transsexuals are Nazis or Nazi collaborators. Raymond quotes counterculteral antipsychiatry guru Thomas Szasz to the effect that sometimes profit-hungry doctors have collaborated with governments and corporations in ways that seem to violated their professional ethics to 'first do no harm,' and then she notes that Nazi science was government funded. 'Not so incidentally,' she points out, 'some transexual research has been funded by government grants."
1. "In spite of it being recognized by psychomedical professionals as a legitimate and diagnosable psychopathology, treatments for GID were not covered by health plans in the United States because they were considered 'elective,' 'cosmetic,' or even 'experiments.' This was a truly inexcusable double bind - if GID was a real psychopathology, its treatment should have been insurable as a legitimate health care need; if treating it was not considered medically necessary, it should not have been listed as a disease."
1. "Lou Sullivan's life was cut tragically short by an opportunistic illness contracted as a result of HIV infection. ... In one of his journal entries after his AIDS diagnosis, Lou mused about writing to the staff of the Stanford gender dysphoria program to say, 'You told me I couldn't live as a gay man, but no I am going to die like one.'"
1. "Althea Garrison was revealed as the first trans person to have been elected to a state legislature when she won a seat in the Massachusetts statehouse in 1992; she was publicly outed two days later, effectively ending her political career."
1. "Sometimes womanhood is a binding-in-place that needs to be resisted and worked against, and sometimes, de Lauretis said, women want womanhood to stick to them 'like a wet silk dress.'"
1. "Anne Ogborn had seen a Queer Nation member at a large public protest wearing another popular sticker - '/trans /Power/Bi Power/Queer Nation' - with the words 'Trans Power' torn off. She asked the women if those words had been accidentally or purposefully removed and was told that they had been deliberately ripped away because the wearer didn't consider trans people to be part of *her* queer movement. Ogborn went to the next monthly QN meeting to protest transphobia within the group and, in typical QN fashion, was invited to organize a focus group devoted to transgender concerns."
1. "But rather than helping Chase feel normal, the nonconsensual genital surgeries, which severely compromised her sexual functioning later in life, left her feeling mutilated and freakish. When she discovered as an adult what had happened to her as a child, and this it had deliberately been kept secret from her, Chase felt as if her entire live had been built on a lie."  - on an intersex person's experiences with the medical system
1. "The vast majority of children with ambiguous genitalia are eventually assigned as female, because surgeons find it far easier to remove 'excess' tissue than to build up new body structures for genitals deemed insufficient for a normal male appearance."
1. "The first half of the 1990s represented a high-water mark in the tradition of [queer zines], the numbers and frequency of which dropped of precipitously in the middle of the decade, in reverse proportion to the rise of the Internet"
1. "At the outset of the 1990s, only three municipalities in the [United States] offered any kind of legal protection for transgender people living and working in their jurisdictions, and only one state, Minnesota, offered protections at the state level, beginning in 1993. By the time the new century began, there were twenty-six localities with some form of transgender protections, and before the first decade of the twenty-first century came to a close there were more than a hundred, in addition to thirteen states and the district of Columbia."
1. "[Chelsea Manning] was incarcerated in a men's facility... and was subjected to what she and many of her supporters considered to be cruel and arbitrary punishments... The most outrageous charge against her was for 'medicine misuse' because the use-by date on her tube of toothpaste had expired."
