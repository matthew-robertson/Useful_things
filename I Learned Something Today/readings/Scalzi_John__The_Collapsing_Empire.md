Impression:

An extremely light read, this was very much my kinda book both on the initial and re-read. Tore through it in a day or two. Reminiscent of Joss Whedon's irreverant kind of quipping, but it didn't grind on me here (Yes, I know that's kind of just how Scalzi writes, and it probably doesn't warrant comparing to Whedon).

Quotes/Annotations:
1. "Then there is the way that mutinies *actually* happen, involving weapons, violence, sudden death, the officer ranks turning on each other like animals, the crew trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. Then, depending on the way things go, the captain being murdered and tossed out into the void, and then everything backdated after the fact to make it look all legal and pretty, or the mutinous officers and crew being shown the other side of an airlock and the captain filing a Notice of Extralegal Mutiny, which cancels the mutineers' survivors benefits and pensions, meaning their spouses and children starve and are blackballed from guild roles for two generations, because apparently mutiny is in the DNA, like eye color or a tendency toward irritable bowels." - What a setup for the whole setting
1. '"So how did we come out if there's no gravity well?" Inverr asked. "Eva Fanochi probably could have answered that for you," Gineos said. "If you hadn't murdered her, that is."' - Probably not, like ~2.5 people in the universe have any idea what's going on at this point.
1. 'Fin nodded to Rue. "We have two problems right now, Lady Kiva, and they're related. The first is the ban. The second is the rebellion." Kiva furrowed her brow at this. "What does the rebellion have to do with us?" "Politically, nothing. It's just another rebellion"' - Corporations, amirite?
1. "majordomo" - A palace stweard, an Italian term
1. "jabong" - Hawai'ian fruit, essentially a grapefruit. Also called a pomelo.
1. "docent" - roughly "associate professor", or a museum lecturer/tour guide.
1. "Marce, who was in point of fact the only member of the non-janitorial staff to show up on this particular morning, and then only to collect some materials that were not already on the network, didn't dare let them down. He brought them all down to the planetarium and dug into his brain to remember the standard presendation about the Interdependency that the tour docents usually gave." - What a nerd.
1. "Marce, who was personally resolutely apolitical" - uhuh -.-
1. "There was some talk of knighting me this year. My wife and I made a considerable donation to the duke's hospital charity. But such things are up in the air right now." - Capitalism, amirite?
1. "There's no but. You're right. It's just a reminder that war favors the rich. The ones who can leave, do. The ones who can't, suffer." - It's not a subtle book.
1. "We're doomed only if we keep doing what we're doing." - Maybe a little on the nose with the climate-change allegory.
1. "Where her heart was, there was a Naffa-shapes hole." - Rough, given that Marce is for some reason going to fill it.
1. "She looked at him and saw the unremarkable face and unremarkable body and behind both, the reportedly unremarkable mind hapiest in the pursuit of unremarkable pleasures."
1. '"I had a dream where she appeard to me, as you, telling me the Interdependency was a scam." "If I were telling this story, I would have said that I had had a mystical vision of the Prophet."'
1. '"You threw him into *space*?" "Yup." "And he didn't die?" "We only threw him out a little bit."'
1. "Count Jemisin was scheduled ot arrive in two days" - A reference to N.K. Jemisin?
1. "No. How would I know that?" I've been away for more than two years, Mom." - I kind of forgot how much time had passed, since it was all transit time travelling to/from End.
1. "We can give you probabilities on which ones are going to collapse and when. It's not predicting. It's looking at the data and offering the most probably outcomes." - Hey, my man, that's what a prediction is.
