## Technological Dystopias
1. Amazon's self-publishing arm is comfortable with [shockingly racist](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-hate-store-amazons-self-publishing-arm-is-a-haven-for-white-supremacists) stuff. Amazon caught a lot of heat for self-published books back in 2010 when someone self-published a book about grooming. It got approved, then banned, then re-instated, htne banned again. Still seems to be the case that they're just looking for illegal (copyright infringing) things rather than defamatory stuff. Yes, this does mean that Amazon algorithmically pushes some pretty hateful stuff.
1. "One technique is to category squat  that is, classify ones books in low-traffic or obscure categories such as Ancient Greek History to game their rankings."
1. [This Person Does Not Exist](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/) is an common-ish way to generate profile pictures for bots and otherwise anonymous people. Some ways to identify them are [here](https://nixintel.info/osint/signs-youre-following-a-fake-twitter-account/): weird ear asymmetry, and strange teeth are big signs.
1. Look. Crypto sucks in a lot of its forms. Of note, is the racism involved in [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://gordongoner.com/). This includes an extreme similarity between their logo and the Nazi Totenkopf (including the same number of teeth).

### Random facts
1. The `--random-wait` option was added to `wget` in response to "an ill-advised 2001 article". The man page still refernces it.

### Useful ideas
1. A neat sorting method for emails proposed by [Arne Bahlo](https://arne.me/blog/youre-using-email-wrong/): use multiple emails to sort by purpose. They use a bare `inbox` email for humans only, `+papertrail` for things that are important to have but not necessarily read, `+newsletter` for newsletters to look at asynchronously, etc...
