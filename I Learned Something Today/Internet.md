## Technological Dystopias
1. Amazon's self-publishing arm is comfortable with [shockingly racist](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-hate-store-amazons-self-publishing-arm-is-a-haven-for-white-supremacists) stuff. Amazon caught a lot of heat for self-published books back in 2010 when someone self-published a book about grooming. It got approved, then banned, then re-instated, htne banned again. Still seems to be the case that they're just looking for illegal (copyright infringing) things rather than defamatory stuff. Yes, this does mean that Amazon algorithmically pushes some pretty hateful stuff.
