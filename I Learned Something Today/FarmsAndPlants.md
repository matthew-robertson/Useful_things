## Gardening
1. Some herbs that are a bit more shade (and Canadian winter) tolerant: parsley, basil, cilantro, catnip, oregano, and rosemary.
1. Don't overwater your ding dang plants, nerd.
1. "You can read all kinds of things, but you only start learning when your favourite plants start dying." - NicolasCageLovesMe, reddit.
1. ["Square Foot Gardening"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_foot_gardening) is apparently pretty good for beginners.
1. When harvesting basil (and possibly all plants?) you shouldn't take more than 1/3 of the plant if you want it to keep growing.
1. Harvesting leaves near the top of the plan encourages bushier growth, taking ones lower down encourages taller growth.
1. Pretty much all watering is done by watering until water comes out the drainage holes. What changes from plant to plant is how often you do it.
1. Pots with drainage! Otherwise you'll have to dump out water or whatever.
1. Don't repot too often, it'll make plants go into shock, and make them pretty unhappy.
1. Rotate the pots occasionally to prevent them getting leggy and leaning towards the light.
1. Parsley and chives are lower-light plants, but most herbs require full light.

## Plants
1. Hops apparently heat up after being picked, like a compost heap does. Hopyard fires were a common occurance early in the hop-growing days (The Drunken Botanist, 217).
1. Due to the way smell differs, there's a chemical (phenyl-acetic acid) that half the population thinks is like honey, and the other half is reminded of urine.
1. What we think of as a "fig" isn't the fruit of the plant. It's a syconium - a teardrop-shaped bit of plant flesh that contains clusters of flowers. The fruit is the stringy bit. (The Drunken Botanist, 270)
1. Nowadays figs aren't pollinated at all. Pollination required a wasp to crawl inside the syconium to lay eggs, and they often died in there. I guess people didn't want to pick wasp bits out of their figs (The Drunken Botanist, 270).
1. True Ceylon cinnamon comes from a Sri Lankan tree, and its sticks look like thin tightly rolled bark. Cassia cinnamon, native to India and China is worse for you (higher levels of coumarin), thicker, and forms a double roll instead.
1. Saffron comes from a triploid plant, which has three chromosomes isntead of two, and is sterile because of it.
1. Maraschino cherries are associated with Italy because of World War I. Originally from Zadar, Croatia, political upheaval caused many Croatian farmers to leave for Italy taking their cherry cuttings and recipes with them.
1. Originally only marasca cherries preserved in maraschino could be called "maraschino cherries". The prohibition messed that up though, and led to gross bleached/dyed american "cherries" being sold as maraschino cherries.
1. Citrus fruits are a mess of hybrids. Pretty much everything we know came from the pomelo, the citron, or the mandarin.
1. Oranges don't turn orange naturally unless there are cool nights to break down chlorophyll, like in California. This is partly why Florida is more known for orange juice than fresh citrus.
1. To help warm climate oranges turn orange, ethylene may be used to speed up ripening and the breakdown of chlorophyll. In addition, Texan and Floridian farmers can use Citrus Red No. 2 dye, if the fruit is for peeling and eating, but not juicing (like fruit for grocery stores is assumed to be).
1. Things like turmeric and ginger are rhizomes (underground stems?) unlike carrots or potatoes.
1. Chipotles are just dried jalape√±os. This fact seems to be as surprising to everyone else as it was to you.
1. Ancho and Mulato peppers are both dried poblano peppers, but the first is smoked when green, the other when red.
1. Guarana is about 4 times as caffeine-rich as coffee beans, which is kinda wild. It also seems to react with alcohol in a way that caffeine alone doesn't, and is pretty dangerous to combine as a result. Quite a few people have died from the combination (A Grain of Salt, dr. Joe Schwarcz).
1. Washed poppy seeds, like you'd find on bagels or in noodles, are unlikely to cause any opioid-related effect outside of failing a drug test. Unwashed poppy seeds, like seen in "poppy seed tea" can be used to overdose somewhat easily. (A Grain of Salt, dr. Joe Schwarcz).
1. Kelp grows half a meter a day. What the heck.
1. Citrus is generally grown in (sub)tropical climates, else they're grown in greenhouses.
1. The Soviet Union managed to produce 200k tonnes of citrus over 30k hectares, without greenhouses. [Source](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/04/fruit-trenches-cultivating-subtropical-plants-in-freezing-temperatures.html).
1. The Russian citrologists used "Progressive cold-hardening" to make cold-resistant citrus. It worked by planting trees from seed progressively further north.
1. Radical pruning techniques were also used to make weather-resistant plants, from Dwarf trees, to "Creeping Citrus" plants, made by pruning and guiding the trees into a form only 25cm tall. [Lower here](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/04/fruit-trenches-cultivating-subtropical-plants-in-freezing-temperatures.html).
1.Those techniques didn't save plants in locations where the ground froze though, so they also managed to grow them in trenches, and covered the trenches in the winter. While this works with citrus, it won't work with plants that can't tolerate low light over the winter.
1. The import of avocados from Mexico was [banned in the United States](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-02-01-fi-24310-story.html) until 1997. Wild.
1. American consummption of avocados has risen like 4x [over the last 20 years](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/the-selling-of-the-avocado/385047/) and they're now the most popular fruit in America. This is largely a marketing push. Plus them being delicious, I guess.
1. Watermelons only have black seeds after reaching maturity, [apparently](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9050469/watermelon-breeding-paintings).
1. A 17th-century painting by Giovanni Stanchi shows a rather strange looking [watermelon](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9050469/watermelon-breeding-paintings). The starring evident there can still be seen in modern watermelons that aren't pollinated properly, and probably some other cultivars.
1. Caffeine is a pesticide, and also has some anti-microbial properties. This is why a bunch of more or less unrelated plants include it in both their fruits and their vascular structure.
1. Younger tea leaves produce more caffeine. This is somewhat generally true, and because younger plants tend to produce more chemical defenses before their physical defenses harden (their cells toughening, etc..)
1. We don't know how, but seedlings will leech caffeine into their surrounding area as an anti-competition measure. It somehow makes other plants less likely to seed in the immediate area.
1. [Tumbleweeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbleweed#Environmental_effects) are an invasive species in the USA, and they're kind of terrifying really. [They're](https://youtu.be/hsWr_JWTZss) a huge fire hazard, very thorny, and great at sucking up water other plants need.

## Farming
1. [USDA census from 2012 indicate that something like 22% of farms have less than $1000.00 of income per year.](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1128445471658319872)

## Other Food Production
1. Greek yogurt production is terrible for the environment, taking about 4 times as much milk to make as regular yogurt (which already takes quite a lot of water to raise the cows, etc..)
1. Greek Yogurt byproducts (whey) are hard to dispose of, and protein supplements can't use all of what we produce. This is because dumping it into water will cause the whey to absorb most of the oxygen in the water and suffocate sealife (A Grain of Salt, dr. Joe Schwarcz).
1. Icecream is often manufactured using cellulose from wood pulp. Its purpose is to absorb water and prevent bad refreezing. This is because icecream is smooth due to the small ice crystals in it, caused by agitation during freezing. When you take icecream out of the freezer the top layer melts a bit, if it refroze after that, it would form larger ice crystals and create a crunchy top layer.
