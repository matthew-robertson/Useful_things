## Plants
1. Hops apparently heat up after being picked, like a compost heap does. Hopyard fires were a common occurance early in the hop-growing days (The Drunken Botanist, 217).
1. Due to the way smell differs, there's a chemical (phenyl-acetic acid) that half the population thinks is like honey, and the other half is reminded of urine.
1. What we think of as a "fig" isn't the fruit of the plant. It's a syconium - a teardrop-shaped bit of plant flesh that contains clusters of flowers. The fruit is the stringy bit. (The Drunken Botanist, 270)
1. Nowadays figs aren't pollinated at all. Pollination required a wasp to crawl inside the syconium to lay eggs, and they often died in there. I guess people didn't want to pick wasp bits out of their figs (The Drunken Botanist, 270).
1. True Ceylon cinnamon comes from a Sri Lankan tree, and its sticks look like thin tightly rolled bark. Cassia cinnamon, native to India and China is worse for you (higher levels of coumarin), thicker, and forms a double roll instead.
1. Saffron comes from a triploid plant, which has three chromosomes isntead of two, and is sterile because of it.
1. Maraschino cherries are associated with Italy because of World War I. Originally from Zadar, Croatia, political upheaval caused many Croatian farmers to leave for Italy taking their cherry cuttings and recipes with them.
1. Originally only marasca cherries preserved in maraschino could be called "maraschino cherries". The prohibition messed that up though, and led to gross bleached/dyed american "cherries" being sold as maraschino cherries.
1. Citrus fruits are a mess of hybrids. Pretty much everything we know came from the pomelo, the citron, or the mandarin.
1. Oranges don't turn orange naturally unless there are cool nights to break down chlorophyll, like in California. This is partly why Florida is more known for orange juice than fresh citrus.
1. To help warm climate oranges turn orange, ethylene may be used to speed up ripening and the breakdown of chlorophyll. In addition, Texan and Floridian farmers can use Citrus Red No. 2 dye, if the fruit is for peeling and eating, but not juicing (like fruit for grocery stores is assumed to be).
1. Things like turmeric and ginger are rhizomes (underground stems?) unlike carrots or potatoes.

## Farming
1. [USDA census from 2012 indicate that something like 22% of farms have less than $1000.00 of income per year.](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1128445471658319872)
