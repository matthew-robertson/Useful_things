## Bouldering
1. When trying to do a dyno to your right, reach for the hold with your left. This seems to help everyone you've told it to.
1. Don't rush into hangboarding or hard crimps. Muscles grow way faster than tendons do.
1. Twist a lot. Getting a hip into the wall instead of frogging out is generally the right play. Helps you reach further.
