## Bouldering
1. When trying to do a dyno to your right, reach for the hold with your left. This seems to help everyone you've told it to.
1. Don't rush into hangboarding or hard crimps. Muscles grow way faster than tendons do.
1. Twist a lot. Getting a hip into the wall instead of frogging out is generally the right play. Helps you reach further.

### Pulley injurys
1. All coming from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWZQMnlHEbg)
1. tendon glides: move the hand between open palm, bent at the first knuckle, and full fist.
1. pen glides: Hold a pen in the first position for tendon glides (fingers bent at first knuckle, back of the hand straight), and try and roll the pen with all fingers.
1. Make sure you're stretching the forearms and everything else upstream as well.
