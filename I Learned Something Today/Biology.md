# Biology, general
1. An [apomorhpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apomorphy_and_synapomorphy) is a trait derived from an ancestral one. If two taxa share the trait, we call it a "synapomorphy", and usually think it evolved in their most-recent common ancestor. An example is the fur of mammals, which is lacked by amphibians. In this case, fur is a `synapomorphy` of mammals, while amphibians retain the original lack of fur (these traits are a plesiomorphy).
1. [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)) refers to a similarity in structures/genes across taxa. The most well-known example is probably how the forearms of humans, front legs dogs/cats/etc.., the wings of birds, and others are all similar structures: sharing something approximating an ulna+radius and wristbones. 

# Fish and Fish accessories
1. When baiting a hook, worms will work for bottom-feeders (like carp), while feathers help for fish that eat surface insects (like trout) (The Feather Thief, p.56)
1. The earliest recorded instance of "fly-tying", which will never make sense to you, is in the 3rd century AD writings of Cladius Aelianus (The Feather Thief, p.56)
1. While trout flys try to mimic their food, salmon flys try to stick out and get salmon to attack them to protect their eggs. This is kind of messed up, and why they're so vibrant (The Feather Thief, p.57)

# Birds
1. The record for most bird species spotted in a year is 4,342. That's a solid chunk of them.
1. There are, probably, about 9-10 thousand species of bird. Though a 2016 study suggested that number might actually be closer to 18 thousand.
1. The feather trade blew up on account of women's fashion (mostly hats), and was subsequently largely banned, also thanks largely to women.
1. The Underwood Tariff Act banned the import of feathers in 1918.
1. Baby owls sleep [face down](https://twitter.com/roook/status/1494691070571069441?s=21). This is because their heads are too heavy and they haven't learned to quite hold them up yet.

# Mammals
1. Cats, unlike all other mammals we've examined, can not taste sweetness. They can taste some other stuff we can't though. [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-cats-cannot-taste-sweets/)
1. [Livestock guardian dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock_guardian_dog) are a dog type bred to protect livestock from predators. This is distinct form herding dogs, and they generally live as a part of the herd and are bonded to the herd from a young age. The only breed you know of previously that was bred for this is the great pyrenees.
1. Not only do hedgehogs hibernate, they're one of the few mammals that "truly" hibernate: they aren't asleep, they've dropped their body temp to match the cold and almost cryo themselves.
1. Cats have "faster" vision than people, which makes us think they couldn't [understand CRTs](https://catbeep.com/can-cats-see-tv/), as they could likely see the individual dots rendering?
1. [Single Cat Syndrome](https://www.seattleareafelinerescue.org/single-kitten-syndrome/) is something that can arise when a young kitten is raised in a single cat household. Effectively, cats learn not to bite/scratch too hard by getting bit themselves/by having other cats tell them, so solo cats can end up aggressive because they never really learned the appropriate way to play with others. It's why a lot of rescures won't let kittens under a certain age to to a single-cat household. Get two.
1. White cats, especially those with blue eyes, are [pretty likely to be deaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_sensorineural_deafness_in_cats). 17-20% of non-blue eyed white cats, 40% of "odd-eyed" cats with one blue eye, and between 65% and 85% of blue-eyed cats are deaf.
1. Cats can scream, and it's a [horrid sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqWqrmsS-uU).
1. When we say a cat is "spitting and hissing", it's not really about the act of spitting saliva. [Spitting](https://youtu.be/xpc_mQ4BVbw?t=60) is a specific sound cats can make, and it sounds kind of like teeth clacking?
1. Surprisingly few big cats can roar: the lion, tiger, jaguar, and leopard (and we think the snow leopard lost its ability to). It's thought that roaring and purring in cats is [mutually exclusive](https://cattime.com/cat-facts/10019-purrs-vs-roars), and the distinction is thought to be due to varying ossification of the hyoid (fully in most cats, but not in roaring cats), and/or due to differently shaped vocal cords (square for roarers, triangular otherwise). The snow leopard is one such cat with a flexible hyoid that can't roar, which is why we think they once could.
1. Snow Leopards don't purr or roar. They make a sound we call [chuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusten) or "prusten".  In Snow Leopards is sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gapw9G5seDE), but [tiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Ts6DRnDGk) and a few other big cats also chuff. 
1. Purring isn't a purely pleased noise, cats will also purr when quite stressed/hurt. It's thought that the purr may have comforting and [healing](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/#:~:text=Cats%20purr%20during%20both%20inhalation,bone%20density%20and%20promote%20healing.) properties, given the frequencies they operate at. Apparently investigations have found that frequencies between 25-150Hz can help improve bone density.

# Humans in general
1. "Brown is a colour that doesn't really exist" - [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU&feature=youtu.be)
1. "Brown is a colour that exists due to context, not wavelength"
1. Magenta is a colour that our brains made up, detected by things emitting high and low wavelength light, but not much in the middle. This is why it isn't in the rainbow. - [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU&feature=youtu.be)
1.'In analyzing their data, the researchers found “Clerical VDT operators showed much higher levels of visual, musculoskeletal, and emotional health complaints, as well as higher job stress levels, than did control subjects and professionals using VDTs.” In every category of health complaint—from fainting to stomach pain to neck pressure to hand cramps—the percentage of complaints went up among clerical workers stationed at computer terminals, often doubling, tripling, or quadrupling in number. ' (note, VDT stands for Video Display Terminal: a monitor. And professional vs clerical is largely a hierarchical split and is quite gendered.). See [here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dda7/how-the-personal-computer-broke-the-human-body).
1. Also found in that study, the act of using a computer seemed to make the work hurt more and feel less fulfilling.
1. Innie vs Outie belly buttons are [mostly random](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-causes-an-innie-or-outie-belly-button), and don't have to do with how the umbilibal cord was tied/clamped/cut. Innies are much more common, though a few medical conditions can apparently cause outie belly buttons.

# Human medicine
1. Auto-brewery syndrome is a bizarre condition where people end up with brewer's yeast taking over their intestines, turning the carbs they eat into alcohol and making them constantly drunk. (Sawbones: Auto-brewery Syndrome)
1. Short Gut Syndrome is exactly what it sounds like, and might cause auto-brewery syndrome.  (Sawbones: Auto-brewery Syndrome)
1. While your short intestine is about 20ft long, a lot of it isn't strictly speaking necessary. You'll be ok-ish with as little as 6ft. (Sawbones: Auto-brewery Syndrome)
1. Ben Franklin was one of the first to confront the myth that being wet in the cold would get you sick. He knew this because he knew so many sailors, and they weren't constantly sick. (Sawbones: Ben Franklin)
1. Vitamin B12 deficiency is super common, especially in vegans.
1. You only need about 2.4mcg of B12 a day, which is weird given the pills are about 1000mcg. This is because bio-availability is super low, and you'll only absorb about 10mcg of a 500mcg supplement.
1. Evidence for the benefits of cryotherapy is far outstripped by claims. It does, however, produce a powerful placebo effect (A Grain of Salt, Dr. Joe Schwarcz).
1. Lots of nutrition studies are pretty spurious, but as far as research goes, the idea that 5-10 servings of fruits/veg per day will help prevent cancer is about as iron-clad as it gets. (A Grain of Salt, Dr. Joe Schwarcz).
1. Beef has been linked to increased rates of colon cancer, likely due to the oxidation of the iron in it. Not every study has found such a link, but almost every one testing processed meats has found one (A Grain of Salt, Dr. Joe Schwarcz).
1. The first case of HIV/AIDS (unknown at the time) was in 1908, when a hunter contracted it from a chimp's blood.
1. "Patient zero" as a term comes from the AIDS epidemic. He was marked as "patient O" for "Out of California" (and was not the first patient). This was later misread as a 0 however.
1. Tannins, such as those in tea, can cause nausea on an empty stomach, and can lower the bioavailability of Iron, making [iron deficiencies more likely](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29955693/). Notably, the tannins in tea seem to cause this more than "condensed tannins", which are more-often found in foods.
1. [Oral Rehydration Solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy) is a relatively easy to make fluid replacement used to treat dehydration. Packets aside, you can approximate it with sugar and salt in clean water. This solution has reduced the mortality rate of diarrhea by 93%, and is credit with saving over 50 million lives.
1. [Sugar can help heal a burnt tongue](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qkzk2k/eli5_why_does_sugar_help_to_heal_a_burned_tongue/). Glucose can act as a (barely noticeable) painkiller, and as it dehydrates the area helping to block saliva from hitting it, which causes the pain sensation. It also apparently helps speed tissue growth, but that's a double-edged sword as it helps bacteria too. Don't put sugar on a wound elsewhere on your body.
1. The [Langer lines](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/skin-tension-lines), the best known diagram of skin tension lines, were determined by piercing a cadaver skin with an awl and seeing which direction the wounds distorted in. Skin tension lines are used with surgical incisions to minimize scarring.
1. Wound healing is separated into [types/intentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing#Types). Primary is "best" and can happen when this isn't tissue loss, and something is used to close the wound and keep the edges together: typically for things like surgical incisions, scarring is minimal, and healing is fast. Secondary is for wounds where too much tissue damage (burns, tooth extraction sockets, etc...). Tertiary is for wounds that are intentionally left open and observed (typically about 4 days, and tissue grafts are an example) before closing.
1. [Wound Packing](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/health/AfterCareInformation/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=acg8538) is done by filling a wound with gauze (or other packing material). The intent is to keep the wound clean, and to help it heal from the inside out. You always use a single piece of packing, to avoid losing a piece inside of the wound.
1. [Compartment syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_syndrome) is a spooky condition, where pressure in a specific [anatomical compartment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascial_compartment) is increased to the point that insufficient blood supply reaches the tissues. It's nasty, can cause permanent damage within hours, and is usually caused by crush injuries. Treatment is a [fasciotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciotomy): cutting/removal of fascia in the area, usually a big enough area that a skin graft is used to close the wound.
1. [Muscle weakness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness) is graded on a scale from 0 (no contraction) to 5 (normal strength), based on what opposing forces movement can happen. It can also be separated int o "true weakness" (something like muscular dystrophy) and "perceived weakness" (where output is normal, but a person feels it requires more effort, as with chronic fatigue).
1. Grapefruit is known for [messing with drug responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit%E2%80%93drug_interactions). For some, it'll reduce the effect, for others it will intensify it. It's a big problem with anti-depressants, but a surprising amount of medications will say not to take with grapefruit. A single grapefruit can potentially lead to overdose, and it can still have an effect on medication taken up to 3 days after consuming the fruit.

# Virology
1. Viruses are, generally: a sack of RNA with some proteins to help replicate/break into cells/etc..., all surrounded by lipids. The lipids are half for protection, and half for invading cells. [Twitter source](https://twitter.com/PalliThordarson/status/1236549318439387137)
1. Viruses don't last very long on wood or fabric because they can form lots of hydrogen bonds with the surface. Whereas on something like steel it can't, and will just kind of chill until your hand comes and touches it, and it'll hop on. [source](https://twitter.com/PalliThordarson/status/1236549338320343040).
1. Water alone doesn't wash away viruses because it only competes against the hydrogen bonds the virus has formed with your skin, but it isn't usually enough.
1. Soap works though, because it contains fat-like "amphiphiles", which end up tearing the virus apart by attracting its fatty barrier. [Here](https://twitter.com/PalliThordarson/status/1236553248862957569). The soap particles also do a great job of separating the virus from your skin.
