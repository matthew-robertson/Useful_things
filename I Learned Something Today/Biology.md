# Fish and Fish accessories
1. When baiting a hook, worms will work for bottom-feeders (like carp), while feathers help for fish that eat surface insects (like trout) (The Feather Thief, p.56)
1. The earliest recorded instance of "fly-tying", which will never make sense to you, is in the 3rd century AD writings of Cladius Aelianus (The Feather Thief, p.56)
1. While trout flys try to mimic their food, salmon flys try to stick out and get salmon to attack them to protect their eggs. This is kind of messed up, and why they're so vibrant (The Feather Thief, p.57)

# Birds
1. The record for most bird species spotted in a year is 4,342. That's a solid chunk of them.
1. There are, probably, about 9-10 thousand species of bird. Though a 2016 study suggested that number might actually be closer to 18 thousand.
1. The feather trade blew up on account of women's fashion (mostly hats), and was subsequently largly banned, also thanks largely to women.
1. The Underwood Tariff Act banned the import of feathers in 1918.

# Mammals
1. Cats, unlike all other mammals we've examined, can not taste sweetness. They can taste some other stuff we can't though. [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-cats-cannot-taste-sweets/)

# Humans in general
1. "Brown is a colour that doesn't really exist" - [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU&feature=youtu.be)
1. "Brown is a colour that exists due to context, not wavelength"
1. Magenta is a colour that our brains made up, detected by things emitting high and low wavelength light, but not much in the middle. This is why it isn't in the rainbow. - [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU&feature=youtu.be)

# Human medicine
1. Auto-brewery syndrome is a bizarre condition where people end up with brewer's yeast taking over their intestines, turning the carbs they eat into alcohol and making them constantly drunk. (Sawbones: Auto-brewery Syndrome)
1. Short Gut Syndrome is exactly what it sounds like, and might cause auto-brewery syndrome.  (Sawbones: Auto-brewery Syndrome)
1. While your short intestine is about 20ft long, a lot of it isn't strictly speaking necessary. You'll be ok-ish with as little as 6ft. (Sawbones: Auto-brewery Syndrome)
1. Ben Franklin was one of the first to confront the myth that being wet in the cold would get you sick. He knew this because he knew so many sailors, and they weren't constantly sick. (Sawbones: Ben Franklin)
1. Vitamin B12 deficiency is super common, especially in vegans.
1. You only need about 2.4mcg of B12 a day, which is weird given the pills are about 1000mcg. This is because bio-availability is super low, and you'll only absorb about 10mcg of a 500mcg supplement.
1. Evidence for the benefits of cryotherapy is far outstripped by claims. It does, however, produce a powerful placebo effect (A Grain of Salt, Dr. Joe Schwarcz).
1. Lots of nutrition studies are pretty spurious, but as far as research goes, the idea that 5-10 servings of fruits/veg per day will help prevent cancer is about as iron-clad as it gets. (A Grain of Salt, Dr. Joe Schwarcz).
1. Beef has been linked to increased rates of colon cancer, likely due to the oxidation of the iron in it. Not every study has found such a link, but almost every one testing processed meats has found one (A Grain of Salt, Dr. Joe Schwarcz).
