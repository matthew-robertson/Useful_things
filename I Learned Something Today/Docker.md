1. Having issues with space getting eaten up despite your images being pretty small? It might be your logs bloating up over time. add `"log-driver": "json-file", "log-opts": {"max-size": "10m", "max-file": "3"}` to your `daemon.json` docker config  and restart your containers to ensure logs will rotate without growing larger than 10 MB (change as appropriate). Thank [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42510314) for that info.
1. Want to take a look at a container's logs yourself? They're stored at `/var/lib/docker/*container_id*/*container_id*-json.log`, but you can only see them from within a container. `docker run -it --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh` from [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65645462) is good for getting to see them, and probably for other stuff.
1. `docker system prune` will prune all dangling images, containers, and networks. If you'd like to clear out volumes too, you can use the `--volumes` flag.
