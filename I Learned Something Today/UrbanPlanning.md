## Transit
1. Dwell Time - the amount of time a vehicle spends stopped at a station (helped by things like the Presto Pass/OPUS instead of cash/tickets)
1. In 1986 buses in the UK were deregulated everywhere except London, which is absolutely wild.
1. "Rapid Transit" is defined as anything that has its own right-of-way: LRT, dedicated bus lanes, etc...
1. [Marchetti's Constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchetti%27s_constant) posits that people have a roughly constant commute budget of ~1 hour (half hour each way), and if commutes become faster or slower people will adjust (moving further away, faster/slower methods of transport, etc...) until they return to that timeline.
1. The [Downs-Thomson paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downs%E2%80%93Thomson_paradox) states that the speed of car traffic is determined by the door-to-door speed of the next best alternative. The idea is that if car traffic becomes too slow people will switch to biking/busses/etc... to save time, which reduces traffic. This is a real problem for public transport that doesn't get separated lanes, because if your bus/tram is stuck in car traffic, it's *impossible* for it to become a better alternative to a car.

## Architecture

1. Anti-homeless features exist, under then name Hostile Architecture, and they're one of the more inhumane things I've seen.

## Zoning
1. Inclusionary zoning mandates the inclusion of affordable housing.
2. Exclusionary zoning is about forcing groups into or out of an area (i.e.: not allowing apartment buildings). Historically, was used to prevent minorities from moving to middle or upper-class neighbourhoods.

## General City stuff
1. Suburbs came about as a result of White Flight, don't forget that.

## Toronto
1. Metro Toronto was the previous regional government that presided over the City of Toronto. It was replaced during amalgamation in 1998.
1. "Instead of addressing [unsafe water] directly [the Gore & Storrie report] suggested turning a blind eye and building swimming pools."
