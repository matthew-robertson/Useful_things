## Transit
1. Dwell Time - the amount of time a vehicle spends stopped at a station (helped by things like the Presto Pass/OPUS instead of cash/tickets)
1. In 1986 busses in the UK were deregulated everywhere except London, which is absolutely wild.

## Architecture

1. Anti-homeless features exist, under then name Hostile Architecture, and they're one of the more inhumane things I've seen.

## Zoning
1. Inclusionary zoning mandates the inclusion of affordable housing.
2. Exclusionary zoning is about forcing groups into or out of an area (i.e.: not allowing apartment buildings). Historically, was used to prevent minorities from moving to middle or upper-class neighbourhoods.

## General City stuff
1. Suburbs came about as a result of White Flight, don't forget that.
