1. [Tanker Boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_boot) are military boots designed for tank crews. Unlike normal combat boots, they use leather straps over laces+eyelets.

1. [Reactive armor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_armour) is vehicle armor that reacts somehow to the impact of a weapon to reduce its damage. Most commonly, this means [explosive reactive armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_armour#Explosive_reactive_armour), in which high explosive is sandwiched between two plates. On penetration of the first plate, the explosive detonates and hopefully deflects/destroys the projective.

Its use in the weapon is classified, and the process itself is classified." We more or less forgot how to make it for a while, as few manufacting records had been retained and since like 20 years had passed since the plant's mothballing most of the personnel involved had were retired/out of the agency.
