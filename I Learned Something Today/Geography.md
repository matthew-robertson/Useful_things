1. The [Aroma of Tacoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroma_of_Tacoma) is a horrid rotten-eggs/sulfur smell that affects the Tacoma Tideflats. Thought to be caused by the Simpson Tacoma Kraft pulp and paper mill, or a couple other things. Note that the smell's largely gone away since the pulp mill switched their combustion tech, which seems damning.
