## Interviewing
1. You're interviewing the company as much as they're interviewing you. Find out what's important to you, ask some tangential questions, and pay attention to the interviewers' answers. https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ncqti/no_palantir_your_internships_are_not_worth_5/dcfbnwd/
1. If you don't have a physical offer in hand, it doesn't exist.
1. Interviewing other people is a great way to get better at interviewing. Pay attention
1. A handful of good questions to bring into an interview, stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/qrmwpc/questions_ive_asked_during_interviews/):
    1. "What is the career progression path like for my position at this company"
    1. "Can you give me an example of a technical (non-management track) leader at your company, and what their position/responsibilities are like?"
    1. "What does an effective employee look like in this position to achieve top ratings in reviews"/"what does a successful first year look like?"
    1. "Why is this role open? New growth? Did someone occupy it previously? If so, why did they leave?"
    1. "What are the goals of the company currently, and how will my position be used to further these goals?"
    1. "How are requirements delivered to engineering teams?" (more generally, what's the development life-cycle like?)
    1. "How frequently do you deploy? What happens when one fails?"
    1. "What's the most difficult project you've assigned/worked on at this company? Why was it difficult? What was the outcome?"
    1. "Are we given time to address tech debt? Is tech debt tracked?"

## Being a good developer
1. Make physical records of agreements, keep people on the same page.
1. It's far better to be good and liked, than great and hated. Don't be a dick.
1. References are incredibly important. Be reliable, treat people well, ask for references before leaving.
1. Make use of RRSP matching, and any other employer benefits. It's free money.
1. Deadlines are more flexible than you think they are, but you still need them.
1. Estimate higher than you think you need.
1. Don't stagnate. Change titles and/or environments every few years (at least at first)
1. Understand that it gets harder and harder to shift tools/industries as you progress.
1. Personal projects are easier to keep going than to start up after years.
1. Make use of 1-on-1s to improve yourself.
1. Don't touch non-work sites during work. It makes everything feel slower.
1. Learn about your industry beyond the software you immediately work on.
1. NETWORK.
1. If you have trouble, do some quick research, then ask your team. They're here to help, and that means you'll have to help them too. This is good.
1. Spend as little time crunching as possible. Burning out will always end up costing more. Besides, you have a life outside of work.
1. Raises (and negotiations) can be for more than just cold, hard, cash. Extra vacation time, for example, can be something more easily given by your manager.
1. Make sure you keep your users in mind. Think a bit like a designer, make sure what you're building makes sense with how/why/when people use it. [Justin Etheredge](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/)
1. Communication is a hugely important skill. Practice it by by blogging, writing documentation, etc... Your team (and your future self) will thank you. [Justin Etheredge](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/)
1. Starting to run into diminishing returns from skill improvements with respect to career stuff? Do what you can to [do less, but more impactful work](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nyldve/why_i_stopped_only_writing_code_and_you_could_too/). Code is a side-effect of actually solving problems. Get bigger scale work, help co-workers get more done, etc...
1. As you become more senior, you're generally given a bit more leeway with your time (and broader goals). This is an invitation to spend time fixing the problems *you* see as an issue. "As a senior, youâ€™re expected to be able to take higher level business objectives and run with them on your own. You shouldn't be viewing your assigned work as the entire extent of your responsibilities. You should view it as the starting point." - [PragmaticFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/u1wxkw/comment/i4f4ikg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)


## General skills
1. Sometimes, it's more advantageous to find a niche with less competition, instead of trying to be better than everyone else.
1. You can't be all things, and spreading yourself too thin will have disadvantages. Figure yourself out a nice competitive advantage in a niche.
1. Your soft assets (skills, knowledge, network, etc...) are hugely important, and you need to dedicate time to improve upon them.
1. Studies seem to indicate that when people get referrals to jobs, they tend to be from "weak contacts": people you only see at most once or twice a year, so breadth in your network is handy.
1. These weak ties tend to give better leads because if your closer contacts know about something, chances are you do too.
1. How do you get a mentor? It mostly comes down to finding people who will *continue* to answer your questions. [A few steps](https://commoncog.com/blog/be-good-to-your-mentors/):
    1. Many people are willing to answer at least one question
    1. You "earn the right" to continue asking questions by *taking action* on the last answer the person gave you
    1. Then, when you come back, you say some form of "last time we met, you told me to do so-and-so. I did so-and-so, and here's what happened. Thank you, I have a new problem now..."
    1. If you aren't getting especially helpful answers, consider if you really want to keep going to them for advice.
    1. If you *can't* say "you told my to try X and I did Y", maybe don't go to them quite yet. You don't have to meet with your mentors frequently.
1. Want to make the most of your 1-1s? You need to make sure your manager knows what you want. Here are some [helpful questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/o7fjdn/advice_for_weekly_11s_with_direct_manager/):
    1. Quite literally just tell them "I want to get promoted to lead", "I want to own bigger initiatives", etc...
    1. "What specific skills do you think our team needs to be successful? Do we have them on the team? How do we grow/hire them?"
    1. "What's keeping you up at night lately?"
    1. "What do you see as the biggest upcoming challenges for our team? How can I/we help?"
    1. "What's keeping me from being promoted? How do I close my gaps?"
    1. Managers hear about a lot more than you do. Ask about initiatives you can volunteer for, etc...
    1. Plan, plan, plan. If you don't come in with notes, it's really easy to slip into "everything's going well". This is especially a problem for you, personally.
    1. Take notes of things that block or interest you, things that annoy you, things you've learned or want to know more about, etc... A good manager will help unblock you.
    1. Ask how we're doing with respect to OKRs/goals.
    1. A list of things to talk about, courtesy of [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1037186572234498048)
1. Remember that your self-worth shouldn't be a function of your total comp. Capitalism's pretty bad at determining value, honestly. [flipstables](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nmodyl/drunk_post_things_ive_learned_as_a_sr_engineer/)
1. Carpal tunnel and back problems are no joke. Use a good chair, get a good keyboard+mouse, etc...
1. There's always going to be a ton of gaps in your knowledge. Get comfortable with that, it means you know things your colleagues don't too. [Justin Etheredge](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/)
1. [Do things, tell people](http://carl.flax.ie/dothingstellpeople.html). Learn things, make things that interest you, spend time on them, this part's easy. Tell people about them, either through blogs, social media, in-person, whatever. There's a lot of cool stuff out there, sharing yours will help you find others'.
1. [help teammates help each other](https://betterprogramming.pub/the-cone-model-for-teams-support-network-9b87659c8008), it takes stress off the manager to not have all the relationships be 1-1.
1. Want to do less? Make sure that everything you own is approaching 0 maintenance cost. This is arguably more important than new features. Fixing flakes, better testing, etc...
1. How do you keep from getting overwhelmed with tasks? This is more of a management thing than an individual thing, but: Say No, both early and often, and be able to explain why. "As early as you hear anybody else's plans that involve your team doing something new, interject with a clear No. Interrupt the conversation and tell them their plan is going to fail if it depends on your work. "We'll do this later" is not enough - you have to show all the things coming in front of their work." - [Alex Turek](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-07-How-to-do-less/). Your Maintenance and New Feature roadmaps are useful here. If the CTO or someone hears this, and still wants you to take it on, sure. Drop the other task entirely.
1. "If someone isn't at least a little disappointed, they didn't hear no. Keep saying it now and in the future." - [Alex Turek](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-07-How-to-do-less/) 
1. Some example ways to say no: "This isn't `MAIN_PRIORITY`, so we aren't going to do it until at least `ESTIMATED_DONE_DATE`", "Right now our priority is `MAIN_PRIORITY` because of `ONE_SENTENCE_JUSTIFICATION`, and this is 100% our shipping focus.", "I agree this sounds like a really useful feature - once we finish `MAIN_PRIOIRITY`, should we consider dropping `SECOND_PRIORITY` and do it?". Thanks [Alex Turek](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-07-How-to-do-less/).
1. "Your whole team needs to default to 'No, we shouldn't do `NEW_THING`', and have to be convinced." - [Alex Turek](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-07-How-to-do-less/)
1. Give more positive feedback: it's easier than negative, makes people feel good, and possibly even more effective than negative. "positive feedback is about finding the 10% of things someone's already doing that are awesome, and saying 'yes! do more of that!'" [Alex Turek](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-18-How-to-criticize-coworkers/)
1. Feedback, positive or negative, is most meaningful if it's highly specific: include links/quotes when possible [Alex Turek](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-18-How-to-criticize-coworkers/).
1. A workable template for giving negative feedback is [here](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-18-How-to-criticize-coworkers/).
1. A piece about presenting your invisible work to help with promotions is [here](https://leaddev.com/staffplus/getting-credit-invisible-work-staff-level):
    1. "Fight recency bias (with snippets)... The key here is to make a habit of summarizing your work at regular intervals.. I do this every other week" "Try to document where you're spending your time and energy, not just the stuff that's obviously work."
    1. "Keep a brag document... I keep a list of my professional successes in a Google Doc. Every time I'm excited about a project going well, I try to make a quick note of it."
