## Video Games
1. It has been proven, mathematically, that a hypothetical game of Tetris must eventually end. There is a string of pieces that are guaranteed to raise your tower.
1. Most every somewhat modern version of Tetris generates pieces using some kind of bag system. It randomizes what order you'll get each piece in, and then repeats that once you've gotten one of everything. That's why you'll never go 20 blocks without seeing a line piece, and will never see 3 back-to-back.
1. King's Quest VI was the first one designed by someone other than Roberta Williams, and is apparently the best one for it. [Source](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/)
1. Sierra was [big into](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/) pushing the audio-visual aspect of the medium, and probably had a big role in the bloating of game budgets. This includes, but is not limited to: An attempt at radio play for the game's tracks, and going to an actual animation studio to make their (pretty rough) opening animatic for KQVI.
1. Sierra, at one point, was trying to port their games to [every system under the sun](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/). This went... with difficulty, from much smaller colourspaces to much less memory, etc... Most were abandoned, the rest barely sold.
1. Unsurprisingly, increasingly large budgets (and in Sierra's case, increasingly large mortgages) led to a lot of pressure to release sellable games at their deadline. This is.. not a great way to make good games.
1. From a [2014 PCGamer investigation](https://www.pcgamer.com/hacks-an-investigation-into-aimbot-dealers-wallhack-users-and-the-million-dollar-business-of-video-game-cheating/), bigger cheat providers could be pulling in millions of dollars a yea. Some claim to sell their tools for hundreds of dollars a month.
1. Unsurprisingly, competitive games (especially shooters) are absolutely riddled with cheaters: aimbots, lag-switches, x-ray modes, all sorts of things.
1. Infinity Ward tries to [match cheaters against each other](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem).
1. The Overwatch community has formed an ["Overwatch Police Department"](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem) that infiltrates cheating rings to try and shut tools down. It's probably less cool than it sounds.
1. Valorant's Anticheat is absolutely [terrifying](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem). It's a kernel driver, always on, and has issues with Notepad, among other things.
1. Leoburke has put together a virtual showroom called [Auto Museum 64](https://leoburke.itch.io/auto-museum-64)], which shows off a bunch of car models from the N64's library.

## Dungeons and Dragons
1. If you're using terrain, you don't have to represent everything. That will leave pressure off you, and give you better opportunities to wow your players. Use a variety of methods: theatre of the mind, battle mat, actual builds.
1. In 5E, ties are generally won by the roller. 
1. Surprise, D&D's been a weird proponent for racial realism for its entire lifespan, likely due to []Tolkien's initial influence](https://www.publicmedievalist.com/race-fantasy-genre/). This manifests most directly in all of the "races" having numerical stat differences between them.
1. Drow, bizzaro-world elves, are a DnD thing. ["The basic template—of black, underground elves—was established by a scant mention in the great 13th-century compendium of Norse mythology, the Prose Edda (which calls them svartálfar). But everything beyond this was determined by the creators of D&D."](https://www.publicmedievalist.com/race-fantasy-genre/)
1. Drizz't actually began as a secondary character, and to date, all 30 of the books involving him by R.A. Salvatore have been best-sellers. Thankfully, Salvatore's thoughts on race have [improved over time](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/interview-r-a-salvatore/)
1. The major problem with making races like Drow and Orcs inherently evil (aside from the implicit weirdness in making dark-skinned "races" evil), is that it paints racism against them as something logical, instead of irrational: If the average Drow is a sadistic torturer, of course it's reasonable to assume any you meet are.

## Magic The Gathering
1. Magic The Gathering is provably turing-complete

## Wargames
1. Don't buy your whole army at once. It's overwhelming and a mistake.
1. Find out the bare minimum you need to get started, and do it. Get the rulebook first.
1. Paint your troops before painting your fancy HQ units: you want your HQs to look nice, so get your experience knowing what you want things to look like by doing the cannon-fodder first.


## Childrens' Games
1. The Floor Is Lava is a [weird](http://www.hollygramazio.net/blog/2020/4/1/the-floor-the-floor) cultural game. Lots of people play it as what you call "Grounders".
1. [Grounders](http://wiki.scouts.ca/en/Grounders) is apparently a game known to Scouts Canada. Who'd have guessed.
1. Only 72.28% of [survey respondants](http://www.hollygramazio.net/blog/2020/4/1/the-floor-the-floor) played the game with the floor being lava. Water type things get up to 11%, and somehow "No particular reason" got 7%.
1. Unsurprisingly, floor danger is regional. Places where lava is a real concern (like Hawai'i), seem to shy away from using Lava.
1. Pippi Longstocking in 1945 has a really quite good description of the game, though without the lava. Probably not the earliest. Lava doesn't seem to show up until the 50's.
