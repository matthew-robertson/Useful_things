# Video Games
1. It has been proven, mathematically, that a hypothetical game of Tetris must eventually end. There is a string of pieces that are guaranteed to raise your tower.
1. Most every somewhat modern version of Tetris generates pieces using some kind of bag system. It randomizes what order you'll get each piece in, and then repeats that once you've gotten one of everything. That's why you'll never go 20 blocks without seeing a line piece, and will never see 3 back-to-back.
1. King's Quest VI was the first one designed by someone other than Roberta Williams, and is apparently the best one for it. [Source](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/)
1. Sierra was [big into](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/) pushing the audio-visual aspect of the medium, and probably had a big role in the bloating of game budgets. This includes, but is not limited to: An attempt at radio play for the game's tracks, and going to an actual animation studio to make their (pretty rough) opening animatic for KQVI.
1. Sierra, at one point, was trying to port their games to [every system under the sun](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/). This went... with difficulty, from much smaller colourspaces to much less memory, etc... Most were abandoned, the rest barely sold.
1. Unsurprisingly, increasingly large budgets (and in Sierra's case, increasingly large mortgages) led to a lot of pressure to release sellable games at their deadline. This is.. not a great way to make good games.
1. From a [2014 PCGamer investigation](https://www.pcgamer.com/hacks-an-investigation-into-aimbot-dealers-wallhack-users-and-the-million-dollar-business-of-video-game-cheating/), bigger cheat providers could be pulling in millions of dollars a year. Some claim to sell their tools for hundreds of dollars a month.
1. Unsurprisingly, competitive games (especially shooters) are absolutely riddled with cheaters: aimbots, lag-switches, x-ray modes, all sorts of things.
1. Infinity Ward tries to [match cheaters against each other](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem).
1. The Overwatch community has formed an ["Overwatch Police Department"](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem) that infiltrates cheating rings to try and shut tools down. It's probably less cool than it sounds.
1. Valorant's Anticheat is absolutely [terrifying](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem). It's a kernel driver, always on, and has issues with Notepad, among other things.
1. zDoom's API is powerful, but an [absolute shambles](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/04/21/elegance/#zdoom-and-pickactor) to work with for something as longstanding and formative as it is. Specific attention is drawn to the ness that is properly selecting an `actor` (read, entity) to operate on.
1. This isn't an especially controversial take, but: People don't come up with new game ideas. We iterate on and cross-pollinate previous things we've seen. A [stark example](https://blog.ihobo.com/2020/10/game-dissonance-2-the-aesthetic-flaws-of-videogames.html) is how FPS controls stem from [Dungeon Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_%28video_game%29): It used arrow keys to move around, which id copied. id later added mouselook as things got more complicated to navigate, and now everyone does it that way. Inventory systems are [similar](https://blog.ihobo.com/2016/08/game-inventories-1.htmlhttps://blog.ihobo.com/2016/08/game-inventories-1.html).
1. "Perplexity" is a fun bit of jargon introduced by [International Hobo](https://blog.ihobo.com/2020/10/game-dissonance-2-the-aesthetic-flaws-of-videogames.html). It refers to cognitive dissonance experienced due to a game not behaving how one would expect from previous experiences. 
1. "Inelegance" is an aesthetic flaw in games similar to Perplexity, but arises between systems in a single game. Warioware is a series that exemplifies this, but kind of avoids it due to it being the whole conceit of the game. The author suggests that like we look back on games like Paradroid as being inelegant for stapling systems together, we may eventually look back on open-world games like Minecraft and its disjointed systems the same way.
1. The third proposed flaw, "Rupture", encompasses ludonarrative dissonance, but also includes things like Final Fantasy or Kingdom hearts' propensity to rip the player out of gameplay and make them reckon with story elements: drawing attention to the mechanical parts of the experience.
1. Minecraft (and all games that use that sort of grid inventory, with equip slots and the option to see your character: Diablo for instance), [derives from a game called Dungeon Master](https://blog.ihobo.com/2016/08/game-inventories-1.html)
1. "Here, we run up against the vagaries of historical research, since while id Software admit to being influenced by dungeon crawl games, no-one will name which. If Dungeon Master were one of them, it would arguably make it the second most influential game after D&D, having set up both the later Western RPG lineage and the FPS lineage."[Game Inventories 1](https://blog.ihobo.com/2016/08/game-inventories-1.html).
1. Sonic 3D has a secret level select that can be accessed via "punching" the cartridge. This is because *every* error handler is set up to take you to the level select screen. Apparently this was a fun trick to have an easier time [making it past Sega's quality control tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9bkKw32dGw) (They're very serious about making sure the games don't crash).
1. [Line Wobbler](https://wobblylabs.com/projects/wobbler) is a 1D dungeon crawler, controlled using a door-stopper spring and a line of LEDs. It's a pretty wild idea.
1. Despite being built to be compatible, a [number of games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_games_incompatible_with_PlayStation_2) for the PS1 can't be played on the PS2. Including Final Fantasy Anthology, the one game in that side-series that I luckily didn't buy.
1. The [Video Game Soda Machine Project](https://vgsmproject.com/) is what you think it is: a quest to document every soda machine in video games. It's *long*.
1. [Moonlander](https://www.acriticalhit.com/moonlander-one-giant-leap-for-game-design/) is pretty groundbreaking in a number of ways. Including: first overworld map, possibly first human character, cutscene, and the first easter egg in a video game. Thanks [Kate Willart](https://youtu.be/z97TfAhDKGk).
1. Atari's Adventure was not only *not* the first video game easter egg, it wasn't even the first one in a cartridge game. That title seems to belong to Fairchild F's [Spitfire](https://youtu.be/z97TfAhDKGk).
1. Atari pretty consistently gets credit for inventing things they didn't. Like Pong (Magnavox Odyssey), or Game Cartridges (Fairchild F), or Easter Eggs.
1. SNES emulation is pretty solid, thanks to folks like Byuu who developed with a focus on accuracy. One extremely tricky bit lies in the PPUs (picture processing units), as they're more or less quite complex black-boxes as far as the SNES is concerned. The original post about the problem is gone, but a mirror of [Edge of Emulation](https://near.sh/articles/emulation/edge-of-emulation) can be found online.
1. The Japanese government used a partnership with Capcom in 2021 to [use Ace Attorney Characters to combat cannabis abuse](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/12/random-ace-attorney-says-objection-to-drugs-in-japanese-anti-marijuana-campaign).
1. [Ken Penders](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Ken_Penders%27_legal_cases) filed for ownership of all the Sonic characters he created as part of the Archie comic. The ensuing suits he filed resulted in *hundreds* of characters being [retconnned out of existence](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/the-lawsuit-that-reshaped-sonic-the-hedgehog-comics.html).
1. A Serial Experiments Lain PS1 interactive CD exists. It's heavily audio based, extremely indie, and developed simultaneously to the show. [It's wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm47V1O78Ts).
1. The battle system in Final Fantasy was 1) designed by someone who didn't play RPGs, and 2) was inspired by his knowledge of professional sports. Specifically, [the NFL](https://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy/3025-194/forums/final-fantasys-battle-system-inspired-by-nfl-564914/).

## Thinking about Games
1. Futile Interactivity is an interesting concept proposed in [this essay](https://www.gwern.net/docs/fiction/2009-fortugno.pdf). In essence, Futile Interactivity is a scene in which the player's control is "false". Consider Final Fantasy's boss fights you *must* lose, or the Shadow of the Colossus post-colossi scenes, in which the player is "killed" by the black tentacles:
```
In a scene of futile interactivity, the player is given agency, apparently as normal... It is
essential that the goal seems normal for the game in which it occurs, and the player
have a natural-seeming control of the character. However, the scene is designed
so that the goal is impossible to achieve... When the trope is well-
constructed, the player attempts to pursue the apparent goal with the belief they can
succeed. Thus, the players can struggle in a typically gamer fashion to make the
goal, and feel the same ambition and emotion they do when they attempt to win in
regular play. But the futility of struggle,..., means that through the use of agency, the
designers can set up the player to feel a certain way as they control the character,
but can then betray those feelings when the scene resolves to designer’s and not
the player’s objective. In this way, futile interactivity gives the designer a way of
using agency in order to create dramatic necessity.
```

## Development and Design
1. Honestly, just a [cool look at designing a 2d Zelda-like game](https://totter87.medium.com/zen-and-the-art-of-retro-level-design-in-kudzu-81cc7545fb3e)
1. From Kudzu's design (and taken from Boss Keys): Instead of backtracking from boss rooms, make use of one-sided short (or long) cuts: possibly a whole new flow. Loops work better than backtracking.

## Nintendo
1. Leoburke has put together a virtual showroom called [Auto Museum 64](https://leoburke.itch.io/auto-museum-64), which shows off a bunch of car models from the N64's library.
1. The Switch's joycons can tell what colour they are because they report a hex-code as [part of their Bluetooth handshake](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/370957). This can be seen (and changed!) using [Joy-Con Toolkit](https://gbatemp.net/threads/tool-joy-con-toolkit.478560/).
1. It turns out "Famiclones" were a [whole thing](https://medium.com/super-jump/the-nintendo-famicom-clone-craze-ebbf69bdd403).
1. "Chinese company Subor shifted its efforts to develop a game console, creating an unlicensed Chinese language version of the Famicom, called the Xiao Ba Wang (‘Little Tyrant”)." Jackie Chan was a brand ambassador for their educational series.
1. The popular Polish Famiclone "Pegasus" was apparently a re-branded Taiwanese clone, of all things, named "Micro Genius". After other Famiclones overtook the Pegasus, they made a deal with Sega to sell a rebranded Genesis. Then the next gen of consoles released in Europe. They bowed out of consoles and now make soft drinks as Hoop.
1. The Russian Famiclone was, of course, the Dendy Junior.

## Dungeons and Dragons
1. If you're using terrain, you don't have to represent everything. That will leave pressure off you, and give you better opportunities to wow your players. Use a variety of methods: theatre of the mind, battle mat, actual builds.
1. In 5E, ties are generally won by the roller. 
1. Consider making your game less lethal: let players choose how enemies exit combat when they drop them to 0, maybe they run away, maybe they surrender. You can extend this to PCs as well. It makes it hit a lot harder when they encounter an enemy who they *know* will fight to the death. Knowing they can lose a fight and end up worse off without crippling the story can do interesting things to strategy.
1. Surprise, D&D's been a weird proponent for racial realism for its entire lifespan, likely due to [Tolkien's initial influence](https://www.publicmedievalist.com/race-fantasy-genre/). This manifests most directly in all of the "races" having numerical stat differences between them.
1. Drow, bizarro-world elves, are a DnD thing. ["The basic template—of black, underground elves—was established by a scant mention in the great 13th-century compendium of Norse mythology, the Prose Edda (which calls them svartálfar). But everything beyond this was determined by the creators of D&D."](https://www.publicmedievalist.com/race-fantasy-genre/)
1. Drizz't actually began as a secondary character, and to date, all 30 of the books involving him by R.A. Salvatore have been best-sellers. Thankfully, Salvatore's thoughts on race have [improved over time](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/interview-r-a-salvatore/)
1. The major problem with making races like Drow and Orcs inherently evil (aside from the implicit weirdness in making dark-skinned "races" evil), is that it paints racism against them as something logical, instead of irrational: If the average Drow is a sadistic torturer, of course it's reasonable to assume any you meet are.
1. To guide players towards a specific plan, Matt Colville will challenge the one that he likes "what will you do about X", "you know Y can happen if you do this", while not saying anything about the bad plans.
1. If you want players to care about your world, you need to chase them up a tree with problems their character sheet can't solve.
1. As a DM, you want to spend as little time as possible speaking. Set your scene, and let the players get going. (Dungeon Master of None)
1. Be careful about showing vs telling. For example, Graduations conceit of "Heroes+Villains are effectively pro wrestlers, hired out for publicity": don't just take a knowledge roll and explain everything in detail, make it happen! They could've gone out as interns or whatever, seen a villain get arrested, and then see them back at the school being pals with the hero.
1. You don't have to start with a "whiz-bang fight", but you *should* give the players something interesting to do ASAP.
1. "If you, as the DM, are talking to yourself: you've fucked something up."
1. The key to interesting NPCs is to, without a ton of effort, know what they want. Sometimes the shopkeeper's motivation is just "I want to make enough to feed my family"
1. You can not set up scenarios predicated on how you think the players will react. It will be incorrect, and you can't force them to feel/respond a certain way.
1. The DM should generally be the straight-person in the comedy duo. Set the scene, let the players make the obvious jokes.
1. "If I roll into town looking for Big Guns the Bandit Lord, only to have the City Watch demand I go to the king's house and fill out tax paperwork, I am understandably going to be annoyed". "The problem isn't your players' decision-making process. The problem is that you gave your party five options for dealing with a problem they were *not interested in dealing with*." - [Tack](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/196654)
1. Players are more motivated by rewards than by fear of consequences. Don't start making their lives difficult until after they've bought in. [StackExchange Post](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/196654).

## Magic The Gathering
1. Magic The Gathering is provably Turing-complete.

### Improving at Magic
1. "The first step to mind-reading is asking opponents questions when you lose" - [Autumn Burchett](https://twitter.com/autumnlilypad/status/1503099602337251332)
1. "Try decks that aren't in your comfort zone" - [Autumn Burchett](https://twitter.com/autumnlilypad/status/1503099602337251332). You can't play around stuff you don't know about.
1. To that point: play more games. Don't *just* play though, you've got to go through again and learn what you played wrong, where your opponent made better plays, etc...
1. Don't play around cards you can't beat, sometimes you've just gotta play to win.
1. Like with improving at anything else, [play against people better than you](https://twitter.com/DGallenMtg/status/1502236250656448523?s=20&t=MHvf0E9TmrUOnWT_xDjYOQ).
1. Plan your turn before you start actually doing it.
1. A neat trick when reviewing replays: pause often, reason through the lines, see if you still agree with your past self.

## Wargames
1. Don't buy your whole army at once. It's overwhelming and a mistake.
1. Find out the bare minimum you need to get started, and do it. Get the rulebook first.
1. Paint your troops before painting your fancy HQ units: you want your HQs to look nice, so get your experience knowing what you want things to look like by doing the cannon-fodder first.
1. The Eldar of Warhammer are named for the [elves of LotR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldar_(Warhammer_40%2C000)#Inspiration).

# Physical Games
1. The Floor Is Lava is a [weird](http://www.hollygramazio.net/blog/2020/4/1/the-floor-the-floor) cultural game. Lots of people play it as what you call "Grounders".
1. [Grounders](http://wiki.scouts.ca/en/Grounders) is apparently a game known to Scouts Canada. Who'd have guessed.
1. Only 72.28% of [survey respondents](http://www.hollygramazio.net/blog/2020/4/1/the-floor-the-floor) played the game with the floor being lava. Water type things get up to 11%, and somehow "No particular reason" got 7%.
1. Unsurprisingly, floor danger is regional. Places where lava is a real concern (like Hawai'i), seem to shy away from using Lava.
1. Pippi Longstocking in 1945 has a really quite good description of the game, though without the lava. Probably not the earliest. Lava doesn't seem to show up until the 50's.
1. What you thought of as "three-ball bowling" is really ["Candlepin Bowling"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlepin_bowling), and is a Maritimes and New England specific variant.

## LEGO
1. [Illegal LEGO techniques](https://youtu.be/PpZjHV1n6Hg) are those that are either too fragile to stay together, or that stress the parts. LEGO sets avoid using these techniques for obvious reasons. An excellent example is stuffing plates in-between studs.
1. Amusingly, there's [one such technique](https://youtu.be/jWtZUzkvQ2E?t=60) that's nearly identical to a legal technique. Its illegality comes down to the `LEGO` logo on normal bricks compared to technic bricks (it adds a slight amount of height).
