## Video Games
1. It has been proven, mathematically, that a hypothetical game of Tetris must eventually end. There is a string of pieces that are guaranteed to raise your tower.
1. Most every somewhat modern version of Tetris generates pieces using some kind of bag system. It randomizes what order you'll get each piece in, and then repeats that once you've gotten one of everything. That's why you'll never go 20 blocks without seeing a line piece, and will never see 3 back-to-back.
1. King's Quest VI was the first one designed by someone other than Roberta Williams, and is apparently the best one for it. [Source](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/)
1. Sierra was [big into](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/) pushing the audio-visual aspect of the medium, and probably had a big role in the bloating of game budgets. This includes, but is not limited to: An attempt at radio play for the game's tracks, and going to an actual animation studio to make their (pretty rough) opening animatic for KQVI.
1. Sierra, at one point, was trying to port their games to [every system under the sun](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/). This went... with difficulty, from much smaller colourspaces to much less memory, etc... Most were abandoned, the rest barely sold.
1. Unsurprisingly, increasingly large budgets (and in Sierra's case, increasingly large mortgages) led to a lot of pressure to release sellable games at their deadline. This is.. not a great way to make good games.

## Dungeons and Dragons
1. If you're using terrain, you don't have to represent everything. That will leave pressure off you, and give you better opportunities to wow your players. Use a variety of methods: theatre of the mind, battle mat, actual builds.
1. In 5E, ties are generally won by the roller. 

## Magic The Gathering
1. Magic The Gathering is provably turing-complete

## Wargames
1. Don't buy your whole army at once. It's overwhelming and a mistake.
1. Find out the bare minimum you need to get started, and do it. Get the rulebook first.
1. Paint your troops before painting your fancy HQ units: you want your HQs to look nice, so get your experience knowing what you want things to look like by doing the cannon-fodder first.


## Childrens' Games
1. The Floor Is Lava is a [weird](http://www.hollygramazio.net/blog/2020/4/1/the-floor-the-floor) cultural game. Lots of people play it as what you call "Grounders".
1. [Grounders](http://wiki.scouts.ca/en/Grounders) is apparently a game known to Scouts Canada. Who'd have guessed.
1. Only 72.28% of [survey respondants](http://www.hollygramazio.net/blog/2020/4/1/the-floor-the-floor) played the game with the floor being lava. Water type things get up to 11%, and somehow "No particular reason" got 7%.
1. Unsurprisingly, floor danger is regional. Places where lava is a real concern (like Hawai'i), seem to shy away from using Lava.
1. Pippi Longstocking in 1945 has a really quite good description of the game, though without the lava. Probably not the earliest. Lava doesn't seem to show up until the 50's.
