# Theatre
1. [Pinter Pauses](http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Pinter_pause) are a way for a playwright to force certain stammering or other silences, like you'd see naturally from people forming thoughts. See [here](https://youtu.be/V5O4mvEK5C4) for an idea of what they sound like. 

# Film
## Weird Trivia
1. The painting in Knives Out was green-screened into every scene it's in, because it wasn't done in time for the start of filming. (https://youtu.be/69GjaVWeGQM)
1. "Bad guys can't use apple phones on camera" - Rian Johnson (https://youtu.be/69GjaVWeGQM?t=177)
1. "Any time you see an actor eating food in a scene, pity them. Because they've been eating that food all day." - Rian Johnson
1. The Harry Potter movies were only filmed in Britain because Warner Bros [campaigned to loosen child labour laws](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2012/02/the-law-behind-the-magic-of-harry-potter/) in the country. Otherwise it likely would have been filmed in the US.
1. Unsurprisingly, Darren Aronofsky is a [fan of Perfect Blue](https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-real-history-of-perfect-blue?s=r), having paid "too much homage" (to quote Kon) to it in Requiem for a Dream (and also in Black Swan, though he denies that). In Aronofsky's telling of his meeting with Kon, Kon is much kinder than Kon tells the story as being.
1. The movie [Krull](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085811/) did a promotion in which [a dozen couples got married on set](https://gizmodo.com/the-krull-wedding-the-most-confounding-scifi-movie-pr-5615160). Bizarrely, this was before the movie even came out.

## Cinematography
1. Watch out for triangles and depth in shots what have multiple actors.
1. Eye-lines are tricky, and you often want to shoot characters such that they're looking towards each other (one left->right, and the other the opposite).
