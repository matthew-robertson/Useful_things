# Theatre
1. [Pinter Pauses](http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Pinter_pause) are a way for a playwright to force certain stammering or other silences, like you'd see naturally from people forming thoughts. See [here](https://youtu.be/V5O4mvEK5C4) for an idea of what they sound like. 

# Film
## Weird Trivia
1. The painting in Knives Out was greenscreened into every scene it's in, because it wasn't done in time for the start of filming. (https://youtu.be/69GjaVWeGQM)
1. "Bad guys can't use apple phones on camera" - Rian Johnson (https://youtu.be/69GjaVWeGQM?t=177)
1. "Any time you see an actor eating food in a scene, pity them. Because they've been eating that food all day." - Rian Johnson

## Cinematography
1. Watch out for triangles and depth in shots what have multiple actors.
1. Eyelines are tricky, and you often want to shoot characters such that they're looking towards each other (one left->right, and the other the opposite).
