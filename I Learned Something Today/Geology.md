# Earthquakes
1. The Southern Part of the [San Andreas Fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#The_next_%22Big_One%22) hasn't had an earthquake in 300 years.
This is because the plates there have been ground so smooth that no small earthquakes can happen there. When the plates inevitably slip, it'll cause "the big one",
since the plates won't have enough dynamic friction to stop moving in a short period of time.

# Volcanos
1. There are three kinds of volcanos:
  1. Ones under the ocean "mid-ocean ridges": caused by plates moving apart and leaving holes for magma to rise from the mantle and fill the space. Interestingly, the density of magma from the mantle results in heavier rock being formed at lower elevations.
  1. Above subduction zones: Vesuvius being a famous example, these volcanos are formed through subduction. As one plate is forced down, friction with the upper plate will eventually melt the rock, which rises through the plate and emerges as a volcano. See also the "Ring of Fire" in the pacific.
  1. Hot spots: Areas where the mantle is, for some reason, exceptionally hot. Examples include Hawaii, Yellowstone, and Iceland.
1. Iceland is incredibly special among volcano having spaces. It's a hot spot coinciding with a mid-ocean ridge, causing way more magma than usual to surface. The whole country is essentially an active volcano, and its oldest rock is 13.5 million years old (The Big Ones, pg.70, ebook).

# Plate Tectonics
1. The continental crust is made of lighter and weakre rock than the ocean floor, which is kinda wild. This caused issues with the idea of continental drift, as the idea that the contintents were pushing themselves apart would be, and I quote "Like pushing a marshmalow through a brick" - The Big Ones, pg.69
1. It turns out, the continents are just carried along by the movement of lithospheric plates. Interestingly, this leads to the ocean floor being - relatively speaking - rather new: the oldest findings on the ocean floor are under 200 million years old, while the oldest continental rock is 3.7 billion.
1. What happens to all the old parts of the Earth's crust? subduction zones happen. When plates collide here, one gets forced down and is (slowly, bit by bit) melted and recycled.
