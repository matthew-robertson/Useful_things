# Earthquakes
1. The Southern Part of the [San Andreas Fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#The_next_%22Big_One%22) hasn't had an earthquake in 300 years.
This is because the plates there have been ground so smooth that no small earthquakes can happen there. When the plates inevitably slip, it'll cause "the big one",
since the plates won't have enough dynamic friction to stop moving in a short period of time.
1. When an earthquake moves on a fault, every point on the faults surface produces shaking. So vertical faults (like San Andreas) concentrate shaking on a single line, while ones in a subduction zone cause strong shaking in a wider area.
1. Earthquakes in China are different, since it doesn't seem to be near the edge of a plate, but still gets them. This seems to be because India's movement northward isn't just pushing the Himalayas up, but pushing China out of the was. This is because pushing mountains up progressively higher takes more and more work, and at some point it became easier to move China than to raise the Himalayas.

# Volcanoes
1. There are three kinds of volcanoes:
  1. Ones under the ocean "mid-ocean ridges": caused by plates moving apart and leaving holes for magma to rise from the mantle and fill the space. Interestingly, the density of magma from the mantle results in heavier rock being formed at lower elevations.
  1. Above subduction zones: Vesuvius being a famous example, these volcanoes are formed through subduction. As one plate is forced down, friction with the upper plate will eventually melt the rock, which rises through the plate and emerges as a volcano. See also the "Ring of Fire" in the pacific.
  1. Hot spots: Areas where the mantle is, for some reason, exceptionally hot. Examples include Hawaii, Yellowstone, and Iceland.
1. Iceland is incredibly special among volcano having spaces. It's a hot spot coinciding with a mid-ocean ridge, causing way more magma than usual to surface. The whole country is essentially an active volcano, and its oldest rock is 13.5 million years old (The Big Ones, pg.70, ebook).
1. [Blue lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_lava), also known as "blue fire" is a blue flame that looks like lava, caused by sulfur burning. This is most common at Indonesia's Kawah Ijen volcano.
1. [Lava tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tube) are big caves formed by lava continuing to flow under a hardened lava surface. They're wild.

# Plate Tectonics
1. The continental crust is made of lighter and weaker rock than the ocean floor, which is kinda wild. This caused issues with the idea of continental drift, as the idea that the continents were pushing themselves apart would be, and I quote "Like pushing a marshmallow through a brick" - The Big Ones, pg.69
1. It turns out, the continents are just carried along by the movement of lithospheric plates. Interestingly, this leads to the ocean floor being - relatively speaking - rather new: the oldest findings on the ocean floor are under 200 million years old, while the oldest continental rock is 3.7 billion.
1. What happens to all the old parts of the Earth's crust? Subduction zones happen. When plates collide here, one gets forced down and is (slowly, bit by bit) melted and recycled.

# Waterways
1. Rivers naturally meander, and naturally create levees. This is because faster moving parts pick up silt that is deposited by slower moving parts.
1. A [Limnic eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnic_eruption) is a kind of disaster that causes dissolved carbon dioxide to suddenly erupt from a lake. The resulting cloud of CO2 can suffocate people and livestock. A famous example is the [Lake Nyos disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Nyos_disaster), which covered a 25km wide radius, killing ~1700 people and ~3500 livestock.

# Tsunamis
1. Magnitude 8 tsunamis can produce locally devastating tsunamis, but 8.5 is necessary to move enough traverse an ocean basin.
1. Tsunamis are waves with multiple peaks and troughs, like ripples from a rock dropping in the water. How far apart they are and their relative size depends on the shape of the sea floor.
1. If a trough hits land first, the first sign of a tsunami is seawater receding disconcertingly fast.
1. Damage in a tsunami is mostly dealt by the currents, not by the flooding. It travels through the ocean roughly at the speed of a jet, but as water shallows out it will slow down to the speed of a car. Unsurprisingly, that much water moving at 20mph carries a lot of energy.

# Wind Storms
1. Hurricanes were [originally named](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-are-hurricanes-and-typhoons-named) after the area where they formed. The modern naming system developed in World War II, and only had masculine names added in 1979 after women's groups complained.
1. After an especially bad wind storm, the name [will be retired](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-are-hurricanes-and-typhoons-named). Notable examples are: Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, and Irma.
1. A [downburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downburst) (or micro or macrobust) is sort of a reverse tornado: a strong, extremely localized, downward wind forces (usually in a thunderstorm). They tend to last seconds to minutes, and only a handful of km wide.
1. A [derecho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho) is a wild seeming kind of wind storm that's essentially a straight line of wind. They can be caused by successive downbursts.

# The Earth
1. [Tired Mountain Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_mountain_syndrome) is something mountains can experience after underground nuclear bomb testing. The large explosions change the geology of the area substantially enough to weaken the surrounding rock and increase the risk of radioactive stuff leaking out.
1. [Sailing Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_stones) are a wild phenomenon where rocks create huge tracks on a smooth valley floor without animal intervention. It's caused by very thin ice sheets forming, breaking up, shoving rocks via wind, and then evaporating.
1. There's a belt of democrat-voting counties cutting through the deep south. Why? To make a long story short: [becuase of a 100 million year old coastline](https://www.deepseanews.com/2012/06/how-presidential-elections-are-impacted-by-a-100-million-year-old-coastline/). The marine life there led to richer soil, which gave exceptionally productive agricultural land (cotton especially), which led to more slaves being taken there, and now manifests as a large black population which overwhelmingly votes Democrat. 
1. [Tepui's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepui) are tableop mountains found in South America that are host to extremely unique endemic plants+animals. One is the source of the Angel Falls.
1. A couple kinds of caves exist. The most commint ad [solutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave), which happens in soluble rocks (mostly limestone) as the acid in groundwater dissolves joints/faults and forms caves. A consequence of this is that 1) caves are wet, always, and 2) you *know* water wants to flow through a cave, since it already has once before.
1. [Show caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_cave), also known as commercial/tourist/public caves, are ones that are publically accessible for guided visits: with lights, trails, etc...
1. [Nutty Putty Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutty_Putty_Cave) was rather famously the site of a fatal accident in 2009. Prior to this, four separate rescues had been performed of Boy Scouts who had become stuck, causing the cave to be closed in 2006 and re-opened in 2009. John Edward Jones became stuck and subsequently died after a 28 hour rescue operation. At one point he had been mostly extricated before a pulley failed and he fell back in. He died 8 hours later of cardiac arrest due to strain due to his inverted compressed position. The cave has since been collapsed near his body, and the entrance filled with concrete.
1. [Mossdale Caverns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossdale_Caverns) had a tragedy in 1967 in which 6/10 cavers entered the cave. When the other four returned after exploring elsewhere, they found the cave completely submerged due to rainfall swelling a nearby stream. All six died while making their way through a long crawl. The cave was sealed, but later re-opened so their bodies could be buried. It is the most deadly indicent in British caving.
1. [Neil Moss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Moss_incident) died in Peak Cavern after becoming jammed underground. Initial attempts to haul him out failed via the rope breaking. Eventually he passed out due to buildup of carbon dioxide at the base of the shaft. He never regained consciousness, and was likely the first British person to be declared dead without the doctor being able to see the body.
1. [Floyd Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Collins) died of dehydration in Sand Cave, so named because it wasn't really a cave and would shift around, while exploring for an entrance to Mammoth Cave. As his lamp began to die, he became trapped by a 26lb rock that pinned his leg and gravel that partially buried him. As a known caver, no one worried until the next day. The rescue effort was large and prolonged, he eventually died roughly two weeks later. The rescue was the third largest media event between the world wars, and Floyd was interviewed while in the cave. Notably, people started doing hoaxes about it, at one point faking a telegraph from Floyd alleging he wasn't actually in the cave.
1. The longest successful cave rescue in Britain took [54 hours and 300 rescuers](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-the-tuesday-edition-1.6242754/it-took-240-people-54-hours-to-rescue-a-man-trapped-in-a-welsh-cave-1.6243142)

# Rocks
1. Diamonds are classified by [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_type), which is a measure of the level and type of impurities in them. The effect is largely on the diamond's colour. Type I diamonds have nitrogen as their main impurity, with Type Ia being 95% of natural diamonds, and Type Ib having fewer, more diffuse impurities. Type II have no measurable nitrogen impurities, though Type IIb have significant boron impurities.
