# Earthquakes
1. The Southern Part of the [San Andreas Fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#The_next_%22Big_One%22) hasn't had an earthquake in 300 years.
This is because the plates there have been ground so smooth that no small earthquakes can happen there. When the plates inevitably slip, it'll cause "the big one",
since the plates won't have enough dynamic friction to stop moving in a short period of time.
