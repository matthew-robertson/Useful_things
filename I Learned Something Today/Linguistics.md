## English

1. Ablaut Reduplication is weird. We like to put words with a before ones with o, and i before either: Tick-tock, chit-chat, big-bad-wolf.
1. Adjectives have an unspoken order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. Hence, no "green great dragons," but there are "lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knives"
1. Zounds began as a euphemism for "By his wounds" (back when wound was pronounced like in "I wound the clock").
1. Swiss German is provably context-sensitive (https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/Biblio/Papers/shieber85.pdf).
1. English is also provably context-sensitive, via constructions like "the square roots of 16, 9, and 4 are 4, 3, and 2 respectively".
