## English

1. Ablaut Reduplication is weird. We like to put words with a before ones with o, and i before either: Tick-tock, chit-chat, big-bad-wolf.
1. Adjectives have an unspoken order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. Hence, no "green great dragons," but there are "lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knives"
1. Zounds began as a euphemism for "By his wounds" (back when wound was pronounced like in "I wound the clock").
1. Swiss German is provably context-sensitive (https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/Biblio/Papers/shieber85.pdf).
1. English is also provably context-sensitive, via constructions like "the square roots of 16, 9, and 4 are 4, 3, and 2 respectively".
1. Women seem to lead language changes, but if it's not creating something new there's no gender difference. As an example of such a non-creation change: "Canadians say 'obviously' more than 'of course'". ("From Uptalk to Vocal Fry, Women Are Prolific Language Innovators", Lexicon Valley)
1. The [Winograd Schema Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winograd_Schema_Challenge) is an NLP challenge where programs have to identify the antecedent of tricky sentences. Ones that should be entirely unambiguous to people, but tough for computers: `I could not put the trophy in the suitcase, becuase it was too big` for example.
1. [Soda pop gets its name from](https://kitchensavvy.com/how-soda-pop-got-its-name): 1) bicarbonate of soda to try and replicate the fizziness of seltzer, and 2) the sound it makes when you open a bottle.

## French

## Other languages
1. Verbs gets marked with gender suffixes in Russian (and tons of others), unlike in English. Sometimes it's based on the speaker, sometimes it's based on the person being spoken to, sometimes it's something else. ("From Uptalk to Vocal Fry, Women Are Prolific Language Innovators", Lexicon Valley)
1. To quote John McWhorter, languages spoken by smaller groups tend to be more complicated, not less.

## Language Learning
1. No one resource is going to get you all the way there. Pick a few things, and just get going. Don't get caught up trying to find the "best" resources.
1. Actually starting to immerse (reading, listening, mainly) is important. You're never going to feel ready, you've gotta just hop into it.
1. When reading, don't dive *too* deep into it, you'll burn yourself out. Sometimes you've gotta look stuff up, sometimes you don't.
1. When immersing, make sure you set measurable goals: reading X pages, for Y minutes, etc..
