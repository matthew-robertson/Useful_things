# Terrain building
1. Etching foam with a pencil (sharp, or blunt), is super handy because the graphite lets you see what you're actually etching.
1. If you're using a pencil though, it has to be really short so you can maneuver it well.
1. Pencil etching works better on some german green foam, vs the pink foam you see in a lot of terrain building videos. This is because it's firmer for some reason, and rebounds less.
1. Scenic glue (very watered down PVA glue) is super handy for "setting" things like sand, gravel, etc...
1. If you're building a corner for terrain, you can either do additive stuff and build actual bricks, or you can fake it by butting the walls against a "corner" piece that has the right texture.
1. Tinfoil balls are great for adding texture. Make sure to do it before you use a brick cylinder (or whatever), since doing it after can distort patterns in weird ways.

# Miniature painting
1. "If you're spending 100 hours on a miniature, spend 60 of those on the face" - some miniac video. The face is where people should be looking. Make sure it looks good.
1. You need to use lighting to draw the eye to where you want it to (probably the face). Apply stronger highlights towards the face, things like that,
1. The paper mats that come with sta-wet palettes are meant for heavy-body acrylics, not stuff like mini-painting acrylics. Use parchment paper instead (not wax!).
1. Clean your brush frequently, and use that opportunity to reshape the head of the brush.
