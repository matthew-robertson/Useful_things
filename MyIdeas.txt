Ideas I haven't acted on:
	- Get a domain name/hosting
		- Set up some sort of devblog/portfolio
	- Rebuild Legend of M to be not super shitty maybe
	- Raytrace a tower of cubes/pyramid of spheres
	- Figure out and contribute to Dolphin you friggin nerd (or like any thing opensource)
	- Do a post-mortem on Legend of M, Dungeon Crawler, Terrae Rasa, or 3D-game
	- Write about my work at Autodesk and/or with USD
	- Write about any of the shaders/math I've worked with
	- Simple Ray marcher + scene so I can try implementing various lens effects:
		- Bloom
		- Depth of Field
		- Translucency
		- Tilt-shift
	- Do something with bump-mapping, something that's a tunnel, etc...
		- https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4ttSRj is crazy
	- Make a pin-table type dealio (equalizer/3d visualiser)
	- Implement some weather effects (fog, snow/rain, maybe I could do thunder/clouds?, etc...)
	- Have a go at recreating Diablo angel wings
	- Get into the modding scene for Crypt or Towerfall
