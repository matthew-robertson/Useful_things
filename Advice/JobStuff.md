## Interviewing
1. You're interviewing the company as much as they're interviewing you. Find out what's important to you, ask some tangential quesitons, and pay attention to the interviewers' answers. https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ncqti/no_palantir_your_internships_are_not_worth_5/dcfbnwd/
1. If you don't have a physical offer in hand, it doesn't exist.
1. Interviewing other people is a great way to get better at interviewing. Pay attention


## Being a good developer
1. Make physical records of agreements, keep people on the same page.
1. It's far better to be good and liked, than great and hated. Don't be a dick.
1. References are incredibly important. Be reliable, treat people well, ask for references before leaving.
1. Make use of RRSP matching, and any other employer benefits. It's free money.
1. Deadlines are more flexible than you think they are, but you still need them.
1. Estimate higher than you think you need.
1. Don't stagnate. Change titles and/or environments every few years (at least at first)
1. Understand that it gets harder and harder to shift tools/industries as you progress.
1. Personal projects are easier to keep going than to start up after years.
1. Make use of 1-on-1s to improve yourself.
1. Don't touch non-work sites during work. It makes everything feel slower.
1. Learn about your industry beyond the software you immediately work on.
1. NETWORK.
1. If you have trouble, do some quick research, then ask your team. They're here to help, and that means you'll have to help them too. This is good.
1. Spend as little time crunching as possible. Burning out will always end up costing more. Besides, you have a life outside of work.
1. Raises (and negotiations) can be for more than just cold, hard, cash. Extra vacation time, for example, can be something more easily given by your manager.


## General skills
1. Sometimes, it's more advantageous to find a niche with less competition, instead of trying to be better than everyone else.
1. You can't be all things, and spreading yourself too thin will have disadvantages. Figure yourself out a nice competitive advantage in a niche.
1. Your soft assets (skills, knowledge, network, etc...) are hugely important, and you need to dedicate time to improve upon them.
1. Studies seem to indicate that when people get referrals to jobs, they tend to be from "weak contacts": people you only see at most once or twice a year, so breadth in your network is handy.
1. These weak ties tend to give better leads because if your closer contacts know about something, chances are you do too.
1. How do you get a mentor? It mostly comes down to finding people who will *continue* to answer your questions. [A few steps](https://commoncog.com/blog/be-good-to-your-mentors/):
    1. Many people are willing to answer at least one question
    1. You "earn the right" to continue asking questions by *taking action* on the last answer the person gave you
    1. Then, when you come back, you say some form of "last time we met, you told me to do so-and-so. I did so-and-so, and here's what happened. Thank you, I have a new problem now..."
    1. If you aren't getting especially helpful answers, consider if you really want to keep going to them for advice.
    1. If you *can't* say "you told my to try X and I did Y", maybe don't go to them quite yet. You don't have to meet with your mentors frequently.
