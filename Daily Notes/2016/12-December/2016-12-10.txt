	- Get a hair cut
	- Submit my work report
	- send that email to Joey with reciepts
	- Update my resume
	- Pick a blog topic/put words on a page
	- Set up wordpress

What I actually did/learned:
	- Got my hair cut
	- Submitted my work report
	- Submitted my travel receipts to Joey
	- Installed wordpress/customised a bit
	- Updated my resume
	- Made bread
	- Wrote most of an article about my implementation of resource orbs
