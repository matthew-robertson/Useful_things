Ideas I had:

What I wanted to do:
	- Submit my work report to Seb
	- pseudocode for translating Jungle to USD
	- Party (Christmassy)

What I actually did/learned:
	- Met with David/Seb about mesh stuff
	- Actually got shit from HSM into USD:
		- most of the vegetation
		- half of the terrain (missing lookout and cliff)
	- Partied
