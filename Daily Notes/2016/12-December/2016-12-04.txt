Ideas I had:

What I wanted to do:
	- Report writing. It's a gogo on the analysis
	- Actually 100% figure out a domain/website
	- Laundry and bread please
	- Track down relocatio nepenses reciepts
	- Figure out if I'm shipping anything

What I actually did/learned:
	- Realised how short my work report could be
	- Fixed up Diablo Shader
		- Added some proper uvs for the orbs
		- Set up way nicer textures
		- Added legit specular highlights
	- Holy crap I actually own a domain now
	- Set up an e-mail/home page
