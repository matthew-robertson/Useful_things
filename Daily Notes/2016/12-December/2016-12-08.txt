Ideas I had:

What I wanted to do:
	- Finish work report
	- Pick a topic for a first blog post
	- Update my resume maybe
	- Figure out how MASH works

What I actually did/learned:
	- Started a wing shader (Diablo 3 Imperius/Tyreal)
	- Researched MASH networks
	- Started a script to grab all meshes from Jungle
	- Did more Overwatch placement matches
	- Finished my work report
