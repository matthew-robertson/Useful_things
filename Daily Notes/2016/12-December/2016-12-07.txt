Ideas I had:

What I wanted to do:
	- Talk to Patrick and ACRD about translating the Jungle to USD
	- Add citations, letter of submittal, and summary to report
	- Write a snow shader
	- Actually start converting the Jungle to USD
	- get reciepts for Joey

What I actually did/learned:
	- Packaged a test scene for Pierre
	- Looked at HSM-City from ACRD
	- Met with Patrick
	- Wrote a snow shader
