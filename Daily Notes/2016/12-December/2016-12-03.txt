Ideas I had:
	- Figure out and contribute to Dolphin you friggin nerd (or like any )
	- Do a post-mortem on Legend of M, Dungeon Crawler, Terrae Rasa, or 3D-game
	- Write about my work at Autodesk and/or with USD
	- Write about any of the shaders/math I've worked with
	- Simple Ray marcher + scene so I can try implementing various lens effects:
		- Bloom
		- Depth of Field
		- Translucency
		- Tilt-shift
	- Recreate Diablo 2 and 3 orbs via fragment shader
	- Do something with bump-mapping, something that's a tunnel, etc...
		- https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4ttSRj is crazy

What I wanted to do:
	- Figure out hosting/domain name tomfoolery
	- Manage to build Augury and run it
	- Bake bread and/or do laundry
	- Write most of my work report analysis section


What I actually did/learned:
	- Removed all compilation errors from Augury, now it's just linker and runtime errors.
	- Wrote my introduction for my work report
	- Wrote a neato shader to imitate Diablo 2 orbs
	- Added notes and my resume to Github
