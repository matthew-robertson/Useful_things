Ideas I had:
	- Make a pin-table type dealio (equalizer/3d visualiser)
	- Implement some weather effects (fog, snow/rain, maybe I could do thunder/clouds?, etc...)
	- Have a go at recreating Diablo angel wings
	- Get into the modding scene for Crypt or Towerfall

What I wanted to do:
	- Verify USD export of geometry
	- Look into geometry variant sets/ other type of variants
	- Finish analysis on work report
	- Link Augury
	- Website work

What I actually did/learned:
	- Figured out how exporting works (the plugin strips the top layer of the selection, so it was removing the xForm for some reason)
	- Fixed an issue with black bars on my Diablo II resource orb shader
	- Figured out how to author geometry and shading variant sets
	- Wrote a script to generate a testShape with modeling and shading variants
	- Wrote the second third of my analysis
	- Did some placement matches
