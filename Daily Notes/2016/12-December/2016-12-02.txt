Ideas I had:
	- Get a domain name/hosting
		- Set up a vanity email
			- yo@marob.ca?
		- Set up some sort of devblog/portfolio
	- Rebuild Legend of M to be not super shitty maybe
	- Make Concentric Circle Test Super small/fast
	- Raytrace a tower of cubes/pyramid of spheres

What I wanted to do:
	- Start actually writing my work report
	- Build/Run Augury for the first time
	- Work stuff
		- Export my own new model to USD
		- Figure out geometric variants
		- Test how updating the stage works in Maya via USD
		- create_set as an assembly (we might not actually want this)
	- Practice Overwatch/Towerfall/Necrodancer

What I actually did/learned:
	- We did some kind of rotation/translation/other transform to USD assets
	- The viewport requires some kind of 'kick' but Maya does seem to recognise/cache updates to the stage without the file needing to be saved.
		Need to figure out what about loading the scene prompts it to redraw these things
	- These cached changes persist through new scenes, probably a bad thing.
	- Had a meeting about the USD prototype, learned at least a little bit about the plan.
	- Did a chunk of Augury set up, need to figure out why it won't find the includes
	- Practiced Necrodancer for a bit, I'm still super bad
	- Played a little bit of guitar, I should start actually practicing
	- Redid Concentric Circle Test
